Master Bug List, Standard ML of New Jersey as of June 26, 1991.
Most of these bugs have been fixed; these are all bugs ever reported.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Identifier as functor body (dbm)
Problem: 
  Using a parameter structure variable as the body of a functor yields an
  error message.
Code:
   functor F(structure A: sig end) = A
Messages:
   Error: unbound structure id: A
Comment:
Status: fixed in 0.20, along with some related bugs involving lack of
  visibility of parameters on the rhs of functor declarations.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Mispelled nonnullary constructors in patterns
Problem: 
  Mispelling a constructor with arguments in a pattern leads to misleading
  error messages.
Version: 0.18
Code:  (in typing/typecheck.sml)
      ...
	       app genType rvbs
	   end
       | EXCEPTIONdec(ebs) =>
	   let fun checkWeak(VARty(ref(UNBOUND id))) = 
		     if tyvarWeakness id > abs
		     then condemn "type variable in exception type too strong"
      ...
Status: Fixed in 0.50
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Redefining an open structure at top level
Problem:
  It appears that redeclaration of an opened structure S releases the
  runtime binding of S, even though we can still refer to its component
  x.  We get the effect of a kind of dangling reference.  Need to avoid
  reclaiming S if S is open at the point where it is redeclared.
Version: 0.18
Code:
    - structure S = struct datatype t = A val x = A end;
    structure S : <sig>
    - S.x;
    val it = A : S.t
    - open S;
    open S
    - x;
    val it = A : t
    - type t = bool;
    type t = bool
    - x;
    val it = A : S.t
    - structure S = struct end;
    structure S : <sig>
    - x;
    uncaught exception Intmap
    - 
Comment:
  Need to detect the fact that a structure has been opened at the top level
  and if so it's lvar binding should not be deleted from the top-level environment.
Status: fixed in 0.20.  top level opens copy bindings into top level environment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. duplicate specifications not checked
Problem:
  No checking for duplicated specifications in signatures.
Version: 0.18
Comment:
  This should be done when building the signature symbol table.
  See bug 81.  (elg)
Status: fixed in 0.73
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. exportML environment
Problem:
  Subtle bug in exportML: it exports the environment of the person who
  originally booted the system, and this environment is restored when
  the image is started up.  This effects system, execute, and
  subsequent exportML's.  On startup, exportFN destroys the environment
  and command-line args, and this too could have adverse effects on
  those functions.
Version: 0.18
Status: fixed in version 0.31
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. open file descriptors
Problem:
  File descriptors open in the ML system remain open on a call of system.
Version: 0.18
Comment:
  I haven't decided what I want to do about this yet.  We
  might like only stdin, stdout, and stderr to remain open.
  Note that if the parent closes one of them, it will be closed in the
  child as well (it inherits them rather than getting new ones).
  Note that
	  ioctl(fd,FIOCLEX,(void *)0)
  will cause a file descriptor to be closed on an exec.  This could be
  called after each open (but shouldn't be called on pipes).
  Another possibility is just to leave them all open.
Status: not a bug, reflects Unix semantics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. constructor representation
Problem:
  There is a bug involving constructor representation.  The compiler
  examines the structure of a datatype and tries to determine an efficient
  runtime representation for it.  For example, for the list datatype, nil
  can be represented as an integer, and :: can just be a pointer to its
  tuple argument (integers and tuples are distinct).  This fails in our system
  at the structure level.  For example:
Version: 0.18
Code:
    signature S = sig
	type 'a t
	datatype 'a list = nil | :: of 'a t
    end
    structure A : S = struct
	datatype 'a list = nil | :: of 'a * 'a list
	withtype 'a t = 'a * 'a list
    end
Comment:
  Here the compiler can deduce the efficient representation for the
  (local) list datatype in structure A; but this cannot be deduced in
  the signature S (an object of type 'a t might not be a pointer).
Status: An error message is now generated (0.54) when this occurs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. interactive error recovery
Problem:
  In the interactive mode, parser error recovery should be suppressed
  (but isn't); the parser may continue to look for input after an error,
  when the user would expect to be back at top level.
Version: 0.18
Status: Fixed in 0.52
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. behavior at limits (e.g. stack overflow)
Problem:
  The behavior of the system when it reaches limits is sometimes bizarre.
  For instance, on a Sun, if the system runs out of stack space it
  will die with "Illegal instruction".  This is because the signal can't
  be handled since the stack is full.  A possible fix would be to use a
  separate stack to handle signals, but the handler would have to be
  smart, since SIGSEGV would be raised.  Note that the stack limit can
  be changed with the limit command; and hopefully this particular bug will
  disappear with the next version of the code generator.
Version: 0.18
Status: fixed in version 0.31
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. exhaustiveness messages at top-level
Problem: Top level bindings should not report on exhaustiveness, but they do.
Version: 0.18
Status: Not important.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. poor error messages [parser]
Problem: Poor error message (parens are needed around the hd::tl pattern):
Version: 0.18
Code:
   -  fun f hd::tl = 4;
Messages:
    Error: expected EQUAL, found ID (::)
    Error: expected nonfix-identifier, found ID ::
    Error: unbound variable bogus
    Error: type error: operator and operand don't agree
    operator : ((wrong*wrong list) -> wrong list)
    operand : (wrong*('aA list -> 'aA list))
    expression:
      bogus :: tl
    - 
Comment:
  The "unbound variable bogus" in particular is confusing.
Status: Fixed in 0.52.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. loss of information in value printing
Problem:
  When printing values formed using constructors created by functor application,
  the argument type of the constructor can sometimes be lost, resulting in
  inability to print the value accurately.
Version: 0.18
Code:
	- functor F(type t) =
	= struct
	=   datatype r = C of t
	= end;

	- structure S = F(type t = int);

	- S.C 3;
  [1]   val it = C - : S.r

  But
  	- signature SS = sig type t datatype r = C of t end;

        - structure S = struct type t = int  datatype r = C of t end;

	- S.C;
	val it = fn : ?.t -> S.r

	- S.C 3;
	val it = C 3 : S.r

  and
	- structure S': SS = struct type t = int  datatype r = C of t end;
	- S'.C;
	val it = fn : ?.t -> S'.r
	- S'.C 3;
	val it = C 3 : S'.r

Comments:
  Printing the argument type of C at [1] yields "IND/1/", indicating that
  the type of C contains an indirection that is not interpreted in context.
  It does not seem possible to recover the context from the structure S, because
  there is no simple way to get back from the type S.r or the DATACON C to the 
  structure environment.  This may be a reason for having type constructors
  contain a pointer to their home structure rather than just the symbolic
  path.  Another alternative would be to follow the path in S.r to find the
  structure S so that we can use it as context for the type of C.
Status: fixed in 0.58
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. printing of types from abstraction structure
Problem:
  Printing of types from an abstraction is not quite right.
Code: (test/sigs/test7)
    signature FOO = 
    sig
       type T1 and T2
       val x1: T1 and x2: T2
       sharing type T1 = T2
    end

    abstraction Foo: FOO =
    struct
       datatype T1 = CON
       type T2 = T1
       val x1 = CON and x2 = CON
    end

    [Foo.x1,Foo.x2];
Messages:
    [-,-] : ?.T1   (* should be Foo.T1 *)
Status: Fixed in 0.56
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. Bad printing of list values
Problem: list values printed with :: instead of [...]
Version:
Code:
    datatype Foo = FOO of int list
    val it = FOO [1, 2, 3]
Messages:
    FOO (1 :: 2 :: 3 :: nil): Foo
Comments:
Status: Fixed in version 0.25.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Error message
Problem: Unfortunate error message (I left out `type'):
Version: ?
Code: 
	- signature STWO = sig structure X:SIG and Y:SIG sharing X.t=Y.t end;
Messages:
	Error: bad path is sharing specification
Comments:
   (It's also misspelled.)
Status: fixed in 0.56
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16. "use" errors
Problem:
  Untidy interface to "use". "use" on a nonexistent file still prints the
  "[opening ...]" message and then raises Io_failure - shouldn't it just
  say "[cannot open ...]" or something?
Status: fixed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17. Inaccurate line numbers
Problem:
	Misleading line numbers for some things (eg. type errors in multi-line
	datatype declarations). Could the system print something like
	"Line 33ff", or a line range a la LaTeX, for these?
Status: fixed in 0.53
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. Bad error messages for illegal record expression
Version: [< 0.16]
Problem:
	interesting diagnostic in the (meaningless) expression
Code:
	- {3};
Messages:
	Error: expected RBRACE, found INT
	Error: type error: operator and operand don't agree
	operator : unit
	operand : int
	expression:
	  () 3

	Error: declaration or expression expected, found RBRACE
Comment:
	What's the "() 3"?
Status: fixed in 0.53
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19. Exception declaration with ":"
Problem: This gives a type error rather than a syntax error: odd:
Version: ?
Code:
		- signature FOO = sig exception Foo of string end;

		- structure Foo: FOO = struct exception Foo: string end;
		                                       =-> ^ <-=
Messages:
		Error: Type in structure doesn't match signature
		name = Foo
		spec = (string -> exn)
		actual = exn
Comments:
  Without signature constraint ":FOO" in declaration of Foo you get a syntax
  error: "expected END, found COLON".  With the signature, you get the above
  type error but no complaint about the ":".
Status: fixed in 0.53
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20. "print" seems overloaded rather than polymorphic:
Problem: print is overloaded rather than being polymorphic
Version: -
Code:
	- datatype Foo = FOO1 | FOO2;
	- print FOO1;
Messages:
	Error: type error: no match for overloaded variable:
	print
Comments:
	according to the original SML report, both "print" and "makestring"
	should be polymorphic identity functions. In our compiler, "print"
	is correctly polymorphic. "makestring" is (incorrectly) overloaded,
	disallowing "makestring FOO1". Needless to say, I want to be able
	to do "makestring" on datatypes.
Status: not a bug
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. Bad error recovery in the typechecker:
Problem:
Version: 0.15a
Code:
	- signature SIG = sig
	     exception Foo of int
	     val A: int
	     val B: int
	     val C: int
	  end;

	- structure S: SIG =
	     struct
		exception Foo: int
			     ^
		val A = 1
		val B = 2
		val C = 3
	     end
Messages:
	Error: Type in structure doesn't match signature
	name = Foo
	spec = (int -> exn)
	actual = exn
	Error: unmatched val spec: A
	Error: unmatched val spec: B
	Error: unmatched val spec: C
	^ there can be a lot of these!
Comments:
	Sometimes the exception error doesn't appear, just giving the unmatched
	spec errors, rather misleadingly.
Status: fixed in 0.53
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22. inherited environment of subprocesses
Problem:
  (one you know about) - subprocesses created via "execute" inherit
  the environment present when the ML system was built! Also: broken
  pipe errors should be caught and raise Io_failure?
Status: fixed in 0.31
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23. circularity in substructure relationship
Problem:
  No checking for circular sharing constraints.  Circular constraints cause
  unhandled Notfound_Table exception.
Code:
	- signature Sig =
	    sig
		structure D: sig
				structure E: sig end
			     end

		sharing D = D.E
	     end;
Messages:
	uncaught exception Notfound_Table
Comments:
  By the way - why is "sharing structure D = D.E" illegal above? (it
  dislikes the word "structure".)
  See bug 33. (elg)
Status:
  Not considered a bug (signature can't be matched, -- this property could
  be statically detected in the compiler, but isn't).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. incomplete write
Submitter: Nick
Comments:
	I'm trying to put in some bullet-proof error recovery into my
	subprocess software, so that "^C" at ML top-level doesn't
	confuse the daemon. What happens if an "output" operation is
	active when ^C is hit - does it do a partial write? I seem to be
	getting some buffer corruption somewhere, as a partial write is
	immediately followed by another complete write. It might make
	my life easier if "output" could be guaranteed atomic under "^C"
	(i.e. any single output operation will complete before Interrupt
	gets raised).
	   Just a thought. I'll perhaps put timers into the daemon and ML code
	so that they flush and restart properly - this may solve the problem.
Status: New signal-handling stuff in 0.56 makes this less important.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25. parser vs grammar (?)
Problem: Parser doesn't accept "vb ::= rec rec vb".
Status: language problem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26. export ML within a use
Problem:
	Awkward behaviour when exportML is called while a file is being
	"use"'d - the saved state falls over with Io_failure. Shouldn't
	restarting clear the use stack?Version:
Status:
  Modified in version 18 so the image doesn't die.  It still raises
  Io_failure, though. (tyj)
  Fixed in 0.56

27. different numbers of arguments in curried clauses cause bogus type error
Version: 0.15
Code:
    fun compose [] = (fn x => x) |
	compose (f::fl) x = compose fl (f x);
Messages:
    Error: type error: rules don't agree
     expected: ('a list -> ('b -> 'b))
     found:
      (f :: fl,x) => compose fl (f x)

28. tyvars in top-level type constraint
Submitter: Carl Gunter, gunter@linc.cis.upenn.edu (also Reppy, 4/20/88)

29. use_string in structure definition
Submitter: Nick
Date: 3/24/88
Version: 0.18
Problem: use_string can cause uncaught Intmap exception
Code:
    - structure Foo =
       struct
	  val x = use_stream(open_string "val _ = Foo.x;")
       end;
Messages:

31. redefining an open structure orphans r/t bindings
Submitter: John Reppy, jhr@svax.cs.cornell.edu
Date: 4/4/88
Version: 0.18
Problem:
    Redefining a structure after opening it makes its components inaccessible
    at runtime even though they are still visible, because the structure
    binding is removed from the r/t intmap environment.
Code:
    val it = () : unit
    - structure S = struct type t = int; val x = 1 end;
    structure S : <sig>
    - open S;
    open S
    - structure S = struct type t = bool; val x = true end;
    structure S : <sig>
    - x;

32. printing loops
Submitter: Andrew

Version: 0.18
Problem: printing a cyclic data structure involving a ref loops
Code:
    datatype A = B | C of A ref
    val x = C(ref B);
    val C y = x;
    y := x;
    x;

33. cyclical sharing not checked, parsing problem
Submitter: Mads
Date: 4/12/88
Version: 0.18
Problem: cyclical sharing not detected, but leads to parsing bug
Code:
    (1)

    signature Sig =
      sig structure a:
	    sig structure b: sig end
	    end
	  structure a': sig end sharing a = a'
	  structure b': sig end sharing b' = a.b
	  sharing a' = b'
      end

    This example should be rejected because it would lead to a cycle in 
    the signature for 'a' (the semantics Section 5.4). If one deletes the
    last sharing obtaining

    (2)

    signature Sig =
      sig structure a:
	    sig structure b: sig end
	    end
	  structure a': sig end sharing a = a'
	  structure b': sig end sharing b' = a.b
      end

    one get a legal program. However these examples do not survive
    parsing. (I get an "uncaught exception Notfound_Table"). Ignoring
    this, will your sharing algorithm cope with this subtlety?
Messages:
    uncaught exception Notfound_Table  (now fixed)
Comments:
    We may not try to find cycles, since they would in any case prevent
    the signature from matching any structure.  [dbm]

Submitter: Bob Harper
Date: 5/20/88
Version: 0.18
Problem:
   (1) missing substructures found in environment,
   (2) bind exception processing sig specs after missing substructure
Code:
    signature SIG = sig type t val x:t end;

    signature SIG' = sig structure S:SIG val y:S.t end;

    structure T : SIG = struct type t=int val x = 3 end;

    structure T' : SIG' = struct structure S=T val y=S.x end;

    (* This yields a sensible error message, then an uncaught exception Bind. *)
    structure T'' : SIG' = struct val y=T.x end;

    signature SIG'' = sig structure T:SIG val y:T.t end;

    (* This should not succeed, but it does!  The unbound structure appears
       in the global environment, so it doesn't notice that the substructure T
       is missing.
    *)
    structure U : SIG'' = struct val y = T.x end;
Messages:
Comments:
    (1) missing substructure was found because lookSTR was being used to
        look for structure components in SigMatch.realize.  Fixed by introducing
	lookSTRlocal that does not search through STRlayer.
    (2) TypesUtil.lookTycPath was causing bind exception because the missing
	substructure defaulted to the unexpected form INDstr(~1).  Caused
	lookTycPath to raise an exception that was caught by typeInContext,
	which then returns ERRORty.  SigMatch.compareTypes ignores the ERRORty.

43. incorrect error message for sharing constraints
Submitter: Bob Harper
Date: 5/21/88
Version: 0.18
Problem:
    "unbound structure id in sharing spec" error message was reporting the
    wrong structure id.
Code:
    signature SIG = sig end;

    signature SIG' = sig
      structure S:SIG
    end;

    (* Here it complains that S' is unbound in the sharing specification, but
    actually it's S'.T that is unbound! *)

    signature SIG'' = sig
      structure S':SIG'
      structure T:SIG
      sharing S'.T = T
    end;

45. equality on simple recursive datatype causes compiler to loop
Submitter: Dave
Date: 5/27/88
Version: 0.19
Problem:
  Compiling equality for a trivial recursive datatype causes the compiler
  to loop in Equal.equal.(test).
Code:
  datatype t = A of t
  fun f(x:t) = (x=x)
Comments:
  Of course this is a useless datatype, but someone could define it by mistake
  and cause the compiler to loop.  The problem is the treatment of datatypes
  with a single transparent constructor in the function test in equal.  It
  recursively calls test on the argument type of the constructor, which in this
  case is justs t again.  A datatype like

     datatype t = A of t * int

  does not cause the loop.
Status: fixed in 0.20
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
46. equality type checking and flexrecords
Submitter: Dave
Date: 6/3/88
Version: 0.20
Problem:
    when flexrecords are used a nonequality type may be accepted in a context
    where an equality record type is required
Code:
    fun f(r as {a,...},true) = (r = r)  (* checks only that a admits equality *)
      | f({b,...},false) = b 3 (* oops, the b field is a function! *)
Messages:
    val f = fn : {a:''a,b:int -> bool} * bool -> bool
    (* argument type is not an equality type *)
Comments:
    A fix probably requires a change in the way flexrecords are represented.
Status: fixed in 0.54.  [actually only correctly fixed in 0.85]

47. scope of user bound type variable
Submitter: Mads Tofte (Edinburgh)
Date: 3/8/88
Version: 0.18
Problem:
  some uses of user-bound type variables have strange effects
Code:
  fun f(x) = let val y : 'a = x in y y end;
  val f = fn : 'a -> 'a
  - f 3;
Messages:
  Error: operator and operand don't agree (bound type var)
  operator domain: 'a
  operand:         int
  in expression:
    f 3
Comments:
  y gets the type !'a.'a, which allows the expression "y y" to type check
  x gets the user bound type variable 'a as its type and it is not generalized
   either when y's type is generalized or when f's type is generalized
  the result type 'a refers to a generically bound type variable which
   coincidentally is printed as 'a
Status: fixed in 0.20
  generates an error message indicating that the user-bound type variable was
  propagated out of its scope.  This is a rather obscure error message, but it
  is not easy to do better.  This seems much better that allowing the propagation
  of the user bound type variable out of its natural syntactic scope, since it
  would be necessary to do arbitrary amounts of type checking to simply determine
  whether two explicit type variables are the same.

48. printing of identity withtype declarations
Submitter: Dave
Date: 6/9/88
Version: 0.20
Problem:
  A simple identity declaration in the withtype clause of a datatype declaration
  will not be printed properly.
Code:
  datatype foo = A
  withtype t = int;
Messages:

Comments:
  This happens because the backpatching of the type constructor puts the new
  name in the defining type as well as in the defined type binding.

    Also, from Dave Berry (2/2/89):
    NJ ML prints the constructors of a datatype when that datatype is
    matched against a "type" in a signature, even if the signature
    doesn't include the constructors.

    This seems a trivial point (except that it's confusing for the novices on
    the course we teach).  However, with some complicated programs the compiler
    bombs out, raising the subscript exception.  You are left in the ML system,
    but it won't compile your code.

    I don't have a small example of this.  It first hit me preparing
    examples for the aforementioned course, and it's just hit me again.

79. withtype
Submitter: Simon (from abstract hardware) via Mike Fourman
Date: 1/31/88
Version: 0.24
Problem:
    "Did you know that the following is not valid ML?

	datatype type1 = T of type2 * type3
	withtype type2 = int (* this could be a large expression *)
	and      type3 = type2 * string;

    The reason is that the "datatype datbind withtype typbind" construct is
    expanded out into "datatype datbind'; type typbind" where "datbind'" is
    the the result of using "typbind" to expand "datbind". Note that this
    construct does *not* expand "typbind" itself, so "type2" is out of scope
    in its occurrence in "type3". This simultaneous definition property of
    "withtype" is quite annoying, especially as there is no way to get the
    effect of sequential definition (other than manually expanding out the
    body of "type3" - but that is precisely the problem that "withtype" is
    supposed to solve)."

Code:
    - 
	datatype type1 = T of type2 * type3
	withtype type2 = int (* this could be a large expression *)
	and      type3 = type2 * string;

81. repeated specs in signatures
Submitter: John Reppy
Date: 2/12/89
Version: 0.24
Problem:
    I noticed that a signature of the form

	    sig
		    val x : int
		    val x : string
	    end

    is acceptable.  Although this is in keeping with redeclaration in other
    scopes, it isn't very useful, and lets detectable errors get by.  I would
    suggest that redeclaration of identifiers in signatures ought to at least
    generate a warning message (if not an error).

86. incorrectly allows redefining of "="

Comment:
    The = symbol may not be redefined (Definition, page 4).  The top definition
    does seem to redefine =, despite the lack of response from the system.
    I can't see anything in the Definition that forbids making = nonfix,
    so I suppose it should be possible to use it in a nonfix way.

   end_of_stream also blocks, and interrupting a call of end_of_stream
   seems to have the same effect.

   jhr:  This isn't a bug, but rather a "feature."  The sub-process inherits
    the control terminal (/dev/tty) from its parent.  This means that the
    SIGINT generated by ^C is passed to both processes.  I assume that
    there is a work-around, but the semantics are correct for Unix.

92. uncaught Nth exception after type constructor arity mismatch in sigmatch
Submitter: David Tarditi, Princeton University, drt@notecnirp.princeton.edu
Date: 6/23/89
Version: 0.33
System: Vax/4.3 BSD
Problem: Mismatching arities on types causes uncaught exception Nth
	 later in signature checking.

Example:

functor OrdSet(B : sig
			type elem
			val gt : elem * elem -> bool
			val eq : elem * elem -> bool
		   end) =
struct
end

structure Bad =
    struct
	type 'a elem = int * 'a
	val gt = fn ((a:int,_),(b,_)) => a > b
	val eq = fn ((a:int,_),(b,_)) => a = b
    end

structure  X = OrdSet(Bad)

Result:

Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.33, 1 April 1989
val it = () : unit
std_in, line 18: Error: mismatching tycon arities: elem
uncaught exception Nth

Comments:

The uncaught exception Nth appears to occur while matching the actual types
of eq and gt against the types in the signature of the formal
structure parameter.

93. type propagation failure with functor application
Submitter: David Tarditi, Princeton University, drt@notecnirp
Date: 7/25/89
Version: 0.33
System: Vax/4.3 BSD
Problem:  Type in a structure passed to a functor remains an opaque
	  type outside the functor.

Example code:

signature T =
sig type 'pos token
end

signature L =
sig structure T : T
end

functor P(structure L : L) =
struct
	open L
end

structure L =
   struct
	structure T = struct
			type 'a token = int * 'a * 'a
		      end
   end

structure B = P(structure L = L)

val x = (5,"","")
val _ = x : string L.T.token  (* this works *)
val _ = x : string B.T.token  (* this causes a type error - why ? *)

Comments:

I thought that the type token should be an abstract (opaque) type only
inside the functor P.  It should be non-opaque in the structure created by
applying the functor P.

Submitter: David Tarditi, Princeton University, drt@notecnirp
Date: 7/25/89

Problem:  The compiler failed by raising a Bind exception
	  which was not caught.

	datatype lcore = LCORE of int
    end

functor mkTable () =
   struct
	structure Dummy = mkDummy()
	structure Lalr = mkLalr()
	val x = fn (Lalr.LCORE l) => l
    end

Comment:
It seems that the compiler fails while compiling an access to a data
constructor inside a functor.  The data constructor must have the
special characteristic that it is created by applying another functor
inside the functor being compiled:

95. infix declaration interferes with type parsing
Submitter: David Tarditi, Princeton University, drt@notecnirp
Date: 4/30/89
Version: 0.33
System: Vax/4.3 BSD
Problem: Spurious declaration of infix for an identifier causes problems
	 when it is used as a type constructor later.

Sample Run:

    Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.33, 1 April 1989
    val it = () : unit
    - type ('a,'b) --> = 'a -> 'b;
    type ('a,'b)  --> = 'a -> 'b

    - val a = fn _ => 5;
    val a = fn : 'a -> int

    - a : ('a,int) -->;
    val it = fn : 'a -> int

    - infix -->;

    - a : ('a,int) -->;
    Error: (user) bound type variable propagated out of scope
      it : 'aU -> int

Comments:
	The declaration of an identifier to be infix should not
affect type constructors.  Infix declarations apply only to data
constructors and value identifiers.  The declaration of '-->' to
be infix should not affect the use of '-->' as a type constructor,
even though the declaration is spurious.

P.S.
	Maybe there should be a way to declare type identifiers to be
infix.  I was trying to declare '-->' to be infix because I was creating
different kinds of arrows for my effects inference.  --> could denote
a function that is pure, while -*-> could denote a function with an
effect.  I need to do this to bootstrap the pervasive environment
without assuming that all built-in functions have side-effects.

97. Type checking
Submitter: Mads Tofte
Date: 6/30/89
Version: 0.33
Description:
Here is a program which, although type correct, does not type check
on the NJ compiler --- one gets a type error in the last line.  
It does type check on Poly ML. 
The problem disappears is one erases the explicit result signature
on SymTblFct and it seems that the problem is that sharing is
not propagated correctly in functor application when the signature
has an explicit result signature.
When the internal type stamps are printed, one sees that
the types of the second and the third arguments are ``abstract''
and not instantiated to the stamps for string and real, respectively.

Code: 
signature IntMapSig=
sig
  type 'a map
  exception NotFound
  val apply: 'a map * int -> 'a
  val update: 'a map * int * 'a -> 'a map
  val emptyMap: 'a map
end;

signature ValSig =
sig
  type value
end;

signature SymSig=
sig
  eqtype sym
  val hash: sym -> int
end;


functor SymTblFct(
  structure IntMap: IntMapSig
  structure Val: ValSig
  structure Sym: SymSig):

    sig
      type table
      exception Lookup
      val emptyTable: table
      val update: table * Sym.sym * Val.value -> table
    end=

struct
  datatype table = TBL of
   (Sym.sym * Val.value)list IntMap.map
  val emptyTable = TBL IntMap.emptyMap;

  exception Lookup
  
  fun update(TBL map,s,v)=
   let val n = Sym.hash(s)
       val l = IntMap.apply(map,n) handle IntMap.NotFound => []
       val newmap= IntMap.update(map,n,(s,v)::l)
    in TBL newmap
   end 

end;

functor FastIntMap(): IntMapSig=
struct  (* dummy implementation of int maps *)
  datatype 'a map = N of int * 'a * 'a map * 'a map  
                  | EMPTY
  val emptyMap = EMPTY
  exception NotFound
  fun apply _ = raise NotFound;
  fun update _ = raise NotFound;
end;

functor ValFct(): ValSig=
struct 
  type value = real
end;

functor SymFct(): SymSig=
struct
  type sym = string
  fun hash(s:sym)= ord s
end;

structure MyTbl=
SymTblFct(structure IntMap = FastIntMap()
          structure Val = ValFct()
          structure Sym = SymFct()
         );
              
open MyTbl;
  
update(emptyTable,"ape",10.0);

Comment: parameters Val and Sym appear in result signature of SymTblFct.
This has not been supported previously.

Comment:
Furthermore, a failing program elaboration or evaluation (such as the above)
should not rebind the variable "it" (ML Standard v3, rules 194 and 195).
NJML sometimes does (as above).

Furthermore, trying to print "it" when it has been bound to such an
exception sometimes seems to crash the system (it refuses to respond to
further input); at other times the exception Runbind is raised.

Does anyone know why the largest integer NJML will parse is 1073741775 ?
This is 2^30 - 49, which seems a funny number to choose. (Mike Crawley
suggests the fact that 49 is the ASCII code for "1" may be significant.)

Error: type variable in exception type not weak enough

- local exception x of '_a in val q = 1 handle x _ => 2 end;
Error: type variable in exception type not weak enough


Comment: the compiler should accept both the above definitions,
         which are valid, since the imperative type variable '_a
         is *not* free in the top level declaration.
Comment: (dbm)  Consider the following, which leads to insecurity:
     local exception X of '_a in val exn0 = X(3) fun h(X(b:bool)) = b end;
     raise exn0 handle e => h(e);

  datatype s = Dummy of bool -> bool
  datatype t = Dummy of int

Comment: NJML accepts this signature but shouldn't. Getting the
         equality attribute right in the presence of sharing
         constraints seems to be quite a tricky problem.

But the scope of ''a and 'b is the whole of the fun declaration.  The problem
seems to be associated with mutual recursion.

  type (''a, 'b)map = (''a *  'b) list

  fun plus(l:(''a,'b)map ,[]: (''a, 'b)map ): (''a, 'b)map = l

Version: 0.33
Problem: 
New Jersey ML does not accept the following functor declaration (it
complains that S.x is not of equality type).  According to the
Definition, two types share only if they have the same name (stamp).
In particular, since equality is an attribute of type names (Version
3, page 16), one admits equality iff the other does (one cannot have
different ``views'' of equality).  

Presumably the problem is a bug in the unification of type names.

Code:
    functor f(structure S : sig type t val x: t end
	      structure T : sig eqtype t end
	      sharing S = T

135. eqtype vs abstype
Submitted: Bernard Sufrin (sufrin%prg.oxford.ac.uk@NSFnet-Relay.AC.UK)
Date: 7/26/89
Version: 0.33
Problem: interaction of abstype and eqtype

I ran into this problem whilst writing you a long note concerning
abstraction bindings structure bindings and their respect for type and
eqtype specifications. Here's a miniature version of the larger
problem.

We want a pair of types Open and Shut, and transfer functions between
them. The two signatures below are candidates for describing such a
structure: the latter leaves visible the equality on Open, the former
should not.

    signature T =
    sig
      type Shut
      type Open
      val Shut:Open->Shut
      and Open: Shut->Open
    end

    signature U =
    sig
      type Shut
      eqtype Open
      val Shut:Open->Shut
      and Open: Shut->Open
    end

Now we design a functor which simply wraps something up in order to shut it.

    functor absT(type Open)  =
    struct
      type Open = Open
      abstype Shut = SHUT of Open  with
	val Shut  = SHUT
	fun Open(SHUT x) = x
      end
    end

Now we instantiate it:

    structure b:T = absT(type Open=int)

Compiler yields:

    structure b :
    sig
      eqtype Shut         <----- can't be right, surely
      eqtype Open
      val Open : Shut -> Open
      val Shut : Open -> Shut
    end

The equality on Shut has leaked, despite the fact that the actual
representation of Shut is an abstype. (The same happens if absT is
itself constrained to yield a T)

    - b.Shut 3=b.Shut 4;
    val it = false : bool

On the other hand using an abstraction binding

    abstraction ab:T = absT(type Open=int)

Compiler yields, correctly,

    structure ab :
      sig
	type Shut
	type Open
	val Open : Shut -> Open
	val Shut : Open -> Shut
      end

but I cannot actually apply ab.Shut to an integer (its domain is not
int, but an opaque and different type, namely ab.Open).  Now let's try

    abstraction au:U = absT(type Open=int)

Compiler yields, correctly,

    structure au :
    sig
      type Shut                                    
      eqtype Open
      val Open : Shut -> Open
      val Shut : Open -> Shut
    end

but I still can't apply au.Shut to an integer. Incidentally in my
original note I asked (a) whether I ought to be able to, (b) if so,
whether eqtype was not getting a bit overloaded [equality visible AND
representation visible] (c) if not, how could one do this sort of
thing at all?

Meanwhile

    structure argh:U = absT(type Open=int)

still makes Open and Shut both eqtypes.  More bizarrely, we have

    abstype opaque = opaque of int with
     val hide = opaque
     val show = fn(opaque x)=>x
    end

    structure biz:T = absT(type Open=opaque)

Compiler yields

    structure biz :
      sig
	eqtype Shut                 <--- wow!
	type Open
	val Open : Shut -> Open
	val Shut : Open -> Shut
      end

Shut is now an eqtype despite being an abstype whose representation
includes another abstype!

139.  compiling with gcc doesn't work 
Submitter: Brian Boutel, brian@comp.vuw.ac.nz
Date: 9 November 1989
Version: 0.36 & later
System: HP/Sun 3
Problem: compiling with gcc doesn't work 
Description:

    I have been trying again to port sml to H-P 68030 boxes running
    MORE/bsd, using the Gnu C  compiler. 

    We have a mix of Sun3 and H-P machines, and, although I have installed
    sml on the suns, it would be convenient to have it available on the H-Ps as well.

    The H-P port has not worked, and to separate the problems arising from
    the Operating System from those arising from the use of gcc, I have
    tried building sml on the suns with gcc (using the -traditional
    option). The build completes, but the resulting sml dies immediately
    while doing a major garbage collection. It does not get as far as
    announcing itself as Standard ML of .....
    I have tried various options, (optimiser on/off some of the gcc -f
    options) without effect. Have you tried gcc? I am anxious to persue
    this as  I think getting a gcc compiled version to run on the suns is
    the right first step towards porting to the H-Ps. Can you offer any suggestions?

    I am using sml version 0.36.  ( I tried today to ftp to
    research.att.com to check for a later version, but found an empty
    directory when logging on as anonymous, and was refused permission to
    log on as mldist.)


    Changes made to the source are summarised as

    ------
    gnu C compiler requires f68881 to be changed to m68881
    Changed in makeml by introducing $CCOMP, set to GNUCC for machine hp300,
    otherwise "", and testing it in defining CFL for M68

    ----------------
    for H-P, sys/exec.h defines MID_HP300 instead of M_68020
    linkdata.c and export.c have conditional code if HP300 defined
    makeml has to pass HP300 to make for linkdata
    -------------
    for H-P, callgc.c has FPE_TRAPV_TRAP undefined, and
    TRAPV returns FPE_INTOVF_TRAP
    so FPE_TRAPV_TRAP is defined as FPE_INTOVF_TRAP in callgc.c
    ----------
    _minitfp_ and _fp_state_mc68881 not defined anywhere for H-P
    .globl omitted if HP300 in M68.prim.s
    --------------------
    run dies because stack clobbered by apply
    Registers saved ala NeXT/MACH in saveregs/restoreregs in prim.s if GNUCC

141. interrupting gc dumps core
Submitter: peter@central.cis.upenn.edu (Peter Buneman)
Date: 18 November 1989
Version: 0.39
System: ??
Problem:
    I've found occasions on which our current version of ML goes a bit
    flakey after being interrupted during garbage collection.  I haven't
    been able to pin it down until now.  The following interactive session
    appears to be repeatable.
Code:
    % sml
    Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.39, 8 September 1989
    val it = () : unit
    - fun foo() = 1::foo();
    val foo = fn : unit -> int list
    - foo();

    [Major collection...
    [Increasing heap to 7144k]
     70% used (1752720/2487664), 4810 msec]

    [Major collection... 62% used (2484132/3975316), 7580 msec]
		  *** I typed <cntrl>C during this garbage collection
    [Increasing heap to 11648k]

    - fun bar() = bar();
    val bar = fn : unit -> 'a
    - bar();      *** I did not type <cntrl>C here !!
    uncaught exception Interrupt
    - bar();      *** nor here!!
    uncaught exception Interrupt

Comments:
    In 0.43d2 I can't repeat this behavior, but interrupting during gc causes
    a bus error or segmentation fault. [dbm]

142. import incompatible with interpreter only image
Submitter: Bernard Sufrin <sufrin%prg.oxford.ac.uk@NSFnet-Relay.AC.UK>
Date: 27 Sept 1989
Version: 0.39
System: Sun 3 ?
Problem: import into interpreter
Description:
    OK; when making the intepreter-only it seems one must:

	    makeml -noshare -noclean -run
	    makeml -ionly -noshare -norun 

    Then one gets the smaller (by about 200k) file. 

    Problem: it is not possible to import precompiled stuff; the compiler 
    decides that the .bin file is not in the right format; tries to recompile,
    and fails for lack of a code generator.

    Here's an example...

    - import "/prg/pl/sml/lib/lex";
    [reading /prg/pl/sml/lib/lex.bin... ]
    [/prg/pl/sml/lib/lex.bin is the wrong format; recompiling]
    [closing /prg/pl/sml/lib/lex.bin]
    [reading /prg/pl/sml/lib/lex.sml]
      [reading /prg/pl/sml/lib/lib/lib/extend.bin... ]
      [/prg/pl/sml/lib/lib/lib/extend.bin is the wrong format; recompiling]
      [closing /prg/pl/sml/lib/lib/lib/extend.bin]
      [reading /prg/pl/sml/lib/lib/lib/extend.sml]
    /prg/pl/sml/lib/lib/lib/extend.sml, line 52: Error: Compiler bug: no code generator!
      [closing /prg/pl/sml/lib/lib/lib/extend.sml]
    [closing /prg/pl/sml/lib/lex.sml]
    IMPORT failed (compile-time exception: Syntax)

    When trying to reproduce the import bug
    you might try making the dependency graph more than three arcs deep.

Comments:
    Obviously we don't want to have to dispense with import
    when using the intepreter-only (typically it'd be students loading
    precompiled libraries), but I presume we don't want the complication of
    lambda-formatted bin files as well as machine code bin files.  May I
    propose the following:

    import from an ionly system should behave like import in the cg system if
    everything is up-to-date.

    if something is out of date, then import should either abort, or behave
    like use (I prefer the latter, I think, but you might make it
    controllable from a System.Control variable).

143. use failes on certain input files of a certain length
Submitter: Jawahar Malhotra (malhotra%metasoft.uucp@BBN.COM)
Date: 26 October 1989
Version: ??
System: ??
Problem: use dumping core on magic input file length
Description:
    I have a source file which contains a signature definition and a
    functor definition. When I load it using the "use" statement, the
    compiler responds with the signature defn and the functor defn but
    then dumps core just before its prints the [<closing file>] line.
    Strangely, if I add another blank line to the file, everything is 
    OK. If you like, I can mail you the file; please let me know if
    you would like the file.

    Here is a reproduction of the compiler's output:

    - use "oareadattr.sml";
    [opening oareadattr.sml]
    signature OAREADATTR = ...
    ...
    ...
      end
    functor OAReadAttrFun : <sig>

144. not waiting for child process
Submitter: Jawahar Malhotra, Meta Software; malhotra%metasoft@bbn.com
Date: 20 Oct 89
Version: 0.33
System: SUN OS 3.5
Problem: 	
	njsml doesn't wait for child process (created by a call to
	execute) to terminate. Suppose I execute the following 
	sml stmt:

	- execute "ls /users/malhotra";

	njsml creates a child process in which it runs ls. When ls 
	is done, it does an exit(0). In order for the exit to
	complete, its parent process (njsml in this case) should
	do a wait(). However, njsml doesn't do this and hence the
	"ls" process blocks on its exit and remains until njsml
	exits. The state of this process (as displayed by "ps") is:

	malhotra  2376  0.0  0.1    0    0 p2 Z     0:00 <exiting>

Comments: 
	One fix would be to prevent the process created by "execute" from
	being njsml's child. In this case, njsml would not have to wait to
	collect the child's termination status. This can be done by
	forking twice. Hence the code for execute might look like:
	(assume njsml is process p1)

	------------------------------------------------------------

	/* in process p1 */

	if (fork() == 0)	{	/* in p2 */
		if (fork() == 0) {	/* in p3 */
			.........			
			execl(......);
			.......
		}
		else {				/* in p2 */
			exit(0);
		}
	}
	
	/* in p1 */

	wait(0);			/* wait for p2 to exit */

	------------------------------------------------------------	

	Another fix (maybe easier to implement) is to install a signal
	handler for SIGCHLD.

	signal(SIGCHLD, ack);

	where ack() is simply:

	ack()
	{
	  wait(0);
	}

145. stale top-level continuations cause type bugs
Submitter: Andrzej Filinski, CMU Computer Science (andrzej@cs.cmu.edu)
Date: Oct 11, 1989
Version: 0.39 (8 September 1989)
System: Sun3/4.3BSD
Problem: Capturing top-level continuation messes up the type system
Code:

    val cl = ref([]:int cont list);
    callcc (fn k=>(cl:=[k]; 42));
    val u = throw (hd (!cl)) 65; (* value 65 with universal type! *)
    u+1;     (* u as integer *)
    u^"str"; (* u as string *)
    u:bool;  (* u as boolean (cannot print) *)
    u:real;  (* u as real (core dump) *)

Comments: This may be a tricky problem, i.e. it is not quite clear
what the "right" behavior should be when the top-level continuation
is captured and carried across commands. Please don't take this as a
criticism of callcc/throw in general, though; they're great! Any plans
for integrating them more deeply in the language, like exceptions?

Problem: compiler out to lunch
Description:
    I have a large-ish list of type:
	    (string * string list) list

    It has 1003 entries, and on average the string list in each pair is around
    3 elements.  Each string is between 5 and 9 characters.

    The list is declared in a file in the form:
	    val graph = [ ("foo", ["bar"]), ... etc ...];
    This is the only declaration in the file. Poly-ml compiles the file
    in about 10 seconds.

    Njml takes around an hour to increase the heap to 30Mbytes, performs several
    major collects, and then bombs with an out-of-memory error.

150. incomplete sharing spec accepted
Submitter:  Simon Finn <simon%abstract-hardware-ltd.co.uk@NSFnet-Relay.AC.UK>
Date: 13 Sept 89
Version: 0.33
Problem:

    signature SIG =
    sig
      type t
      sharing type t

Comments:
    The above signature is illegal, since sharing constraints must involve

157. nested imports corrupt memory (same as 154?)
Submitter: sufrin%prg.oxford.ac.uk@NSFnet-Relay.AC.UK
Date: 3 Nov 89
Version: 0.39
System: Sun 3
Problem:
    I have had a good deal of trouble with transitive imports. Symptom is
    segmentation failure on first call of a procedure defined in a functor
    imported transitively.

    parser:
	    defines abstractsyntax, lexer, and parser functors

    codegen:
	    imports parser
	    defines code generator 

    main:
	    imports codegen
	    instantiates abstractsyntax, lexer, parser
	    crashes at first invocation of procedure defined in parser.

    When I remove the "import parser" from codegen, and 
    import it directly from main, then all is well.

    This actually arose in a student's system, and I haven't time to try it in
    smaller contexts.  Does the symptom sound familiar? If not, I can send the
    whole lot to you.

159. nested structure reference causes compiler bug
Submitter: Tom Murtagh, Rice University, tpm@rice.edu

Version: 0.38 and 0.39
System: Sun4/SunOS 4.0.3c and Sun3/SunOS 4.0.?
Problem: Compiler dies on reference to type from a nested structure
Description:
    I ran into another problem with the compiler.  This one does not
    appear to have anything to do with the port to SPARC.  I ran it
    on a Sparcstation using verion 0.38 and on a Sun3 running version
    0.39 (Bruce's copy) and it died on both.  It compiled without
    complaint on a Sun 3 running verions 0.33 (which is installed
    in the public local software directory here).

Code: (smaller.sml = /usr/sml/bugs/code/bug.159)
    signature SYMTAB =
	sig
	    type ident
	end

    signature LEX =
	sig
	    structure Symtab : SYMTAB

	    datatype lexeme =
		ID of Symtab.ident
	      | DELIM
	end

    structure Symtab =
	struct
	    type ident = string
	end

    functor lex( symtab : SYMTAB ) =
	struct
	    structure Symtab : SYMTAB = symtab
	    datatype lexeme =
		ID of Symtab.ident
	      | DELIM
	end

    structure Lex : LEX = lex( Symtab )

Comment:
    Almost any perturbation of the above seems to make the bug disappear, e.g.
    (1) removing "structure Struct1 : SIG1"
    (2) or removing "type s" from SIG1
    (3) or taking "f" out of "Sub" and putting it at the top level of "Struct2" 
  [dbm] behavior is different under 43d2.  It produces a lookTycPath subscript

Comments:	I changed yesterday (Dec 3) from 0.42 to 0.43, and I have 
		been trying all day (Dec 4) to solve my problem, until I
		made the little test above. During the solving periode I also
		had a lot of:

		    ../file, line xxx: Error: structure sharing violation

		In that periode I was using "import", not "use". These 
		error messages may show up to be caused by the same bug.

Fix: 		Sorry, I'm not able to fix it. But I hope my example have 
		given you enough input to track down the bug.

175. redundant module loading

Version:        0.44

depend on files which have been, or need to be, recompiled?

Problem:
    ... the diagnostic messages for sharing mismatches are not really
    useable: having a single message "structure sharing violation" for 100
    lines of nested functor applications is no use, and I often have to
    recompile the entire system in Poly/ML just to get more verbose
    diagnostics with the context of the offending functor application and
    the names of the offending structures/types.

181. 8-bit characters not supported in strings

Version: 0.44
Problem:
    I am looking to read in 8 bit characters in SML-NJ.  I can get UNIX
    to pass 8 bits back & forth, and SML-NJ will PRINT strings containing
    escaped "8-bit characters" (i.e., \nnn) as honest 8-bit output, but for
    the life of me I cannot get it to READ 8-bit characters when i put them in
    a string (I get an "Ord exception").  Is this intended behavior?
    Is there any workaround (say, a switch I didn't notice?)?

185. exportML size
Submitter: Soren Christensen,
           University of Aarhus, Computer Science Dep.,
           Denmark
           schristensen@daimi.dk
Date:      24 jan 90
Version:   0.44
System:    Sun4/280 / SunOS 4.0.1
Severity:  ???
Problem:
Ussualy I have build my application by declaring a number of structures,
this could be done using less than 45Mb of heapspace, even if I set the
the flags like:

 System.Control.CG.reducemore := 0;
 System.Control.CG.rounds := 10;
 System.Control.CG.bodysize := 20;

The system produced from an "exportML" of this takes up app. 3Mb.

>From "doc/optimize" I learned that the code could be optimized by
enclosing it in one structure. I did like:

structure whole :
  sig
   < ... >
  end =
struct
 <The usual stuff ..>
end;
open whole;

It meant that the heapsize had to be increased to 80 Mb and I had to reset
the above flags.

I observed a bug in the reporting of GC:
...
[Major collection... 76% used (18670576/24426980), 34260 msec]

[Increasing heap to 59632k]

[Major collection... -57% used (25033788/31118476), 44190 msec]

[Increasing heap to 68216k]

[Major collection... -35% used (30575468/34993364), 54880 msec]
...

The "-57%" should be "80%" and the "-35%" should be "87%".

But the main problem  is that the CG before the "exportML" only decreases
the heap to 49Mb, and then it stops with the message "export" - due to no
disk space (?)

Comments: (appel)  Setting these flags for optimization may cause the
code generator to generate very large output.  Use at your own risk.

187. parsing clausal definitions with infix functions
Submitter: Mick Francis
Date: 1/11/90
Version: 0.44(?)
Problem:
    1) Infix function declarations using parentheses do not parse. E.g.
	    infix xxx;
	    fun (a xxx b)   = b; (* Will not compile *)
	    fun (a xxx b) c = c; (* Will not compile *)

    2) When an infix identifier appears as the first of more than 2 formal
       parameters in a function declaration, if the second formal parameter
       is an identifier, an attempt is made to declare a function with this
       name. E.g.
	    infix xxx;
	    fun a xxx b c = c;   (* Compiles function b ??? *)
	    fun a xxx nil c = c; (* Tries to bind nil - error *)

    Incidentally, Poly/ML gets the following wrong :-
	infix xxx;
	fun a xxx b d = d;

    It gives the message :-
	Error- Constructor (b) has not been declared   Found near b(y)

    It appears to be looking for a pat, not an atpat on either side of the xxx.

193. import types
Submitter: Nick Rothwell
Date: 1/5/90
Version: 0.44a (0.44 with import fix)
Problem:
   I've enclosed a bug in NJ SML 0.44a, based on a bug report I received
from people at HP. I've managed to narrow it down to a simple example.
It seems to be a strange interaction between the type import code of the
separate compilation mechanism, the functor typechecking, and the checking
of record types (of all things!). Unfortunately, I don't know anything about
how types are imported under separate compilation, so I can't take it much
further.
Transcript:
I enclose two files, A.sml and B.sml. B.sml is a simple script that imports
A. Try the following: use "B.sml" (so that A gets imported and compiled), and
then >exit the system<. Start another session and use "B.sml" again. You
should get the following error:

        B.sml, line 8: Error: operator and operand don't agree (tycon mismatch)
          operator domain: {X:'S}
          operand:         {X:int}
          in expression:
            FOO {X=3}
Code:
    *** A.sml ***
    signature A =
      sig
	datatype 'a Foo = FOO of {X: 'a}
	    (* Must be a record type to reproduce the bug. *)
      end;

    functor A(): A =        (* Must have sig constraint to reproduce the bug *)
      struct
	datatype 'a Foo = FOO of {X: 'a}
      end;

    *** B.sml ***
    import "A";

    structure ??? = A();    (*Needed to reproduce the bug*)

    functor F(structure A: A) =
      struct
	val _ = A.FOO{X=3}
      end;

194. weak type variable syntax

Version: 0.44?
Problem: 
    There seems to be one slight problem in the documentation on support
    for imperative type variables as described in the Standard.  I took
    the documentation to mean that '_a is an abbreviation for '1a.  This
    isn't true.  If you try the code at the bottom, you'll see this.
Code:
    (* Sample code:  The second declaration of y causes a type error *)
    val x = fn (a,b) => (ref a; ref (a b));
    val y = x : ('1a -> '1b) * '1a -> '1b ref;

Version:        0.43
System:         Sun 3/60 -- SunOs 4.0.3
Severity:       Depends on the the importness of the the noshare
                version of the compiler and exportFn

Problem:        I make standalone versions of the lex and yacc,
                included in the distribution. I use the following
                code, to make a standalone version of "smlyacc", and
                similar for my "smllex" (feeding it to the noshare
                version of sml):

                | use "load.sml";
                | loadAll();
                | open ParseGen;
                |
                | fun main (argv, env) =
                |     let
                |         val argc = length argv
                |         val prog = hd argv
                |     in
                |         (if (argc <> 2) then
                |             outputc std_out ("Usage: " ^ prog ^ " file\n")
                |          else
                |              let
                |                  val file = hd (tl argv)
                |              in
                |                   parseGen file
                |                   handle Io s =>
                |                       outputc std_out
                |                           (prog ^ ": Couldn't open file: "
                |                            ^ file ^ "\n")
                |              end;
                |              outputc std_out "\n")
                |     end;
                |
                | exportFn ("smlyacc", main);

                The problem then is this: When making "smllex"
                everything works fine, and I get (on Sun 3/60) a
                standalone version of 208K. But the "smlyacc" version,
                though it compiles fine and runs, on more than 2000K.

                I used the same procedure with version 0.39, and the
                standalone version of "smlyacc" then was 368K.

                It seems to me that when exporting "smlyacc", the
                runtime system isn't thrown away, as when "smllex"
                was generated.

202. type error not caught?
Submitter: Norman Ramsey
Date: 8/28/89
Version: ?
Problem:
    I believe that the following file should generate a type error, but
    it doesn't.  In particular, the line val _ = begin_str "replicas"
    ufanout(c,chans) should force chans to be type 'a chan list when c is
    type 'a chan.
Code:
    datatype 'a chan = CHAN of 'a

    signature BADGUYS = sig
	val mkchan : unit -> '1a chan
	val ufanout : '2a chan * '2a chan list -> 'b
	val begin_str :  string -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> unit
    end

    signature WONKY =  sig
	val ureplicas : int -> '2a chan -> '6b chan list
		    (* wrong! should be int -> '2a chan -> '2a chan list *)
      end

    functor buggy(bad:BADGUYS):WONKY = struct

    open bad

    fun ureplicas n c =     (* n unsynchronized copies of channel c *)
	let fun channels(l,0) = l

209. equality types and functors, again
Submitter: Appel & MacQueen
Date: 4/30/90
Version: 0.56
Problem:
    Problem in eqtypes/defineEqTycon/eqty.  failure when attempting to
    reevaluate equality properties of generative/defined tycons in functor body
    after functor is applied.
Code: 
    signature S1 = sig type t end;

    functor F(X : S1)  =  
    struct
      structure B = struct datatype s1 = K of X.t end
      type s = B.s1
    end;
    structure C = F(A);
Comments:  we've put in a warning message, and assumed a non-equality type
	when this happens.  (still causes impossible error in 0.56).
Status:	"fixed" by following the lead of the Definition and not recalculating
	equality properties on functor applications.

210. sharing checking with fixed stamps
Submitter: Appel & MacQueen
Date: 5/3/90
Version: 0.56
Problem:
    Union exception is not caught when sharing specs try to identify two distinct
    types or structures (with differing fixed stamps).
Code:
    structure S = struct end;
    structure T = struct end;
    signature Q = sig sharing S=T end;
Comments:
    Easy to fix.  Just add a handler for the Union exception in Sharing.doSharing
    and produce and appropriate error message.

211. Union exception processing correct sharing in functor body
Submitter: MacQueen
Date: 5/4/90
Version: 0.56
Problem:
    Union exception is raised in doSharing when processing correct sharing
    specs in a functor body.
Code: (* bug211.sml *)
    functor F(type t) =
    struct
      structure K =
      struct 
	type s = t
      end
      structure M : sig structure L : sig type s sharing type s = t end
			sharing L=K
		    end =
      struct
	structure L = K
      end
    end;

Comments:
    The bug occurs because the type definition shortcut (for "type s = t", s
    is made a copy (modulo path) of t) is not done when t has a bound stamp,
    as in the code above.  Here s is a DEFtyc tycon with a different stamp
    from t.

Comments:

These problems don't occur on the m68 version of SML. In fact,
the problem with "sin" that I reported previously also doesn't
occur with the m68 version.

Maybe this is an installation problem, but if it is, then there is
probably something wrong with the makeml script. The Sparc version
was generated with "makeml -sun4 -sunos" if I remember correctly.

Problem:

	    [etc...]
Fix:
Some of the problems may be caused by handleprof() in runtime/signal.c
being braindamaged.  I changed it to be:

  SIGH_RET_TYPE handleprof ()
  {
    extern ML_val_t current0[];
    ML_val_t cur_barray = current0[1];
    cur_barray[1] = (unsigned int)INT_incr(cur_barray[1],1);
  }

and it seemed to work for simple examples.  However, I'm not too sure
that the times mean anything for larger examples.  Perhaps there's some
bad interaction with GC?

223. nontty standard input and uncaught exceptions
Submitter:	KINOSHITA Yoshiki	yoshiki@etl.go.jp

Version:	SML of NJ 0.56
System:		Sparc Station 330 (SUN4), SUN-OS 4.0.3 (generic version)
Severity:	major
Problem:	If the standard input is a pipe, the system ends
		abnormally after it sends an error message.

Comments:	This problem makes it impossible to use the system with
		its input sent through a UNIX filter.
  from jhr:
    You might call this a feature.  It appears that the person who wrote
    the top-level loop code (interact.sml), decided that exceptions
    should only be caught at the top-level loop when std_in is a tty
    (look at lines 292-309 in interact.sml).  The following work-around
    avoids the problem

      - 1+2;
      val it = 3 : int
      - 

    But, maybe the code should change.  It isn't clear to me what the correct
    semantics are in this case.  This problem came up here at Cornell when
    Bill Aitken was using "rsh" to run sml on a remote machine.

235. repeated type variables in typdesc and datdesc
Submitter:      Don Sannella <dts@informatik.uni-Bremen.de>
Date:		6/13/90
Version:        0.44?
Severity:       major
Problem:
    The Definition of SML seems to allow repeated type variables in a typdesc and
    datdesc, making the following signatures legal:

    signature SIG1 =
	 sig
	    eqtype ('a,'a) t1
	    type ('a,'a) t2
	 end

    signature SIG2 =
	 sig
	    datatype ('a,'a) t3 = foo of 'a
	 end

    Section 2.9 forbids repeated variables in a typbind and datbind, but I don't
    see anything forbidding it in a typdesc or datdesc.  I assume below that the
    omission of a syntactic restriction here was intentional.

    Repeated type variables in a typdesc seem unproblematic if strange, since the
    semantics only looks at the number of variables.  SML-NJ accepts SIG1 above,
    and treats it the same as a signature without repeated type variables, which is
    correct.

    Repeated type variables in a datdesc are more of a problem, since the
    constructors refer to them.  According to the Definition, foo in SIG2 above
    gets type 'a -> ('a,'a) t3.  Both of the following structures then match SIG2:

    structure A =
	 struct
	    datatype ('a,'b) t3 = foo of 'a
	 end

    structure B =
	 struct
	    datatype ('a,'b) t3 = foo of 'b
	 end

    SML-NJ (version 0.44a) says foo : 'a -> ('a,'b) t3, which is wrong.  The result
    of this is that A matches SIG2 but B does not.  I don't know about Poly-SML,
    since I don't have it here.

Comments:
    I have installed version 0.59 on Vaxes, Suns, and Pmaxes running Mach.

    There were two problems:

    VAX.prim.s contained a reference to the variable maskSignals.
    The name should be _maskSignals instead.

    The file export.c should also include the file ml_os.h, which
    contains some definitions needed for Decstations running Mach.

Version:        v59    4 June, 1990
System:         SUN 3 on bsd
Severity:       minor
Problem:        Toplevel printing of abstype is transparent.
Code:           - abstype Foo = Foo of int
                = with fun foo i = Foo i end
                = val bar = foo 0;

241. sharing constraint error ignored
Submitter:      David Turner
Date:           12 July '90
Version:        0.59
System:         Sun4
Severity:       Slightly irritating
Problem:        Ignores error in sharing constraint even though it
		obviously detects it.

Input:
        - signature S = sig  type t  end;

	- functor F
	    (structure A : S
	     structure B : S
	    	sharing type B.t = A.s) = struct end;

Output:
	Error: unbound type in structure: s
	functor F : <sig>
Comment:
  Nonstandard function used in doSharing to report the bug.
  In 0.65 error message is:
     std_in:9.6-11.23 Error: unbound type in structure: s
  This doesn't provide as much useful information as it should.  Error
  message should read something like "unbound type A.s in sharing spec".

246. repeated import consumes too much memory
Submitter:      Peter Canning  <canning@hplabs.hp.com>
Date:		27 June 1990
Version:        0.56
System:         HP900S370 (m68030)  HP-UX 7.0
Severity:       major
Problem:        repeated use of the import facility causes the heap to grow
Comments:
    In particular, if I repeatedly modify a file, import the file, then run the
    program defined in the file (the standard edit/compile/debug loop), my sml
    image seems to grow (and never shink again).  When I was just using "use",
    sml would garbage collect freqently, but the process size would stay between
    4000 and 5000 Kbytes.  Using import (working on the same program), the
    process has grown as large as 11000 Kbytes.  It appears that for some reason
    some data related to importing/compiling files is not being reclaimed by the
    garbage collector.

248. abstract types are not abstract
Submitter:      Dave MacQueen
Date:		7/16/90
Version:        0.59 (0.57 and later)
Severity:       major
Problem:
   Abstract types defined by abstype declarations are not made abstract
  (i.e. converted from DATAtyc to ABStyc form), and their equality property
  is not reset to NO.  Equality properties of types defined in terms of the
  abstype are not recomputed (see bug 231.)
Comments:
  After the abstype body has been processed, the concrete form of the abstract
  types must be replaced by the abstract form throughout the 'signature' of the
  exported bindings (values, constructors, types).  Also equality properties
  of exported types have to be reevaluated.
  Currently, there is a function that attempts to transform the tycons in the
  type checker, but it affects only the abstract syntax, and not the static
  environment.  The problem results from the removal of the ref around tycons
  in 0.57.
Status: fixed in 0.64.

249. separate compilation printing problems
Submitter:      Nick Rothwell <nick@lfcs.ed.ac.uk> (also Richard O'Neill)
Date:		7/5/90
Version:        0.59
Severity:       minor
Problem:
    0. If only one or other of the files exists (say, Foo.sml without Foo.bin
	or vice versa), the exception SystemCall gets raised.

    1. The error message

		[Foo.bin is in the wrong format; recompiling]

    seems to have lost its closing "]" in 0.59.

    2. The final bindings from a separately compiled module get
    printed on one line, as in:

    signature Asignature Bsignature Csignature D- 

    rather than

    signature A
    signature B
    etc.
Fix:  (Richard O'Neill)
    For some reason the function printBindingTbl in print/printdec.sml was changed
    from its form in release 0.56 to a slightly modified forn in 0.59. The new
    form is functionally equivalent appart from omiting to generate newlines.

    Fix (currently untried):

    Return printBindingTbl to it 0.56 form.
Status: fixed in 0.64(?)

250. interpreter broken
Submitter:      Richard O'Neill (cmp7130%sys.uea.ac.uk@nsfnet-relay.ac.uk)
Date:		Tue Jul 17 12:24:19 BST 1990
Version:        0.59
System:         Sun3, SunOS 4.1
Severity:       Major
Problem:

In interpret mode, version 0.59 fails with no explanation when compiling a
grammar from mlyacc (slightly modified to use 'import'), whilst in compile
mode, the grammar is compiled correctly. Version 0.56 does not exhibit the same
problem.

This seems a significant problem since using compile mode takes significant
time and memory. Equally, I cannot use version 0.56 due to some of its bugs
which manifest themselves when compiling other modules.

I have not included the files as they are rather long (being an mlyacc 
generated parser and the relevant support files). I can supply you with a
uuencoded compressed tar archive of them all if you desire.

251. omits tests for repeated bindings
Submitter:      Dave Berry db@lfcs.ed.ac.uk
Date:		18th July 1990
Version:        0.59
System:         All (I presume; actually tested on a Sun 3 with SunOS 4.0)
Severity:       minor
Problem:        omits tests for repeated bindings
Code:           

type t = int and t = string;

exception E and E;

val rec f = fn x => x + 1
and f = fn n => if n > 0 then 1 else n * f (n - 1);

Transcript:

- type t = int and t = string;
type  t = int
type  t = string

- exception E and E;
exception E
exception E

- val rec f = fn x => x + 1
= and f = fn n => if n > 0 then 1 else n * f (n - 1);
val f = fn : int -> int
val f = fn : int -> int

Comments:

I expect that few people would make these mistakes in "real"
code, but they might be more common when teaching.

The tests are made for repeated constructors in a datatype,
and in some (non-recursive?) value bindings, e.g.

- datatype a = A | A;
std_in:3.14-3.18 Error: duplicate constructor name

- val a = 1 and a = 2;
std_in:2.5-2.19 Error: duplicate variable-name `a' in pattern(s)

Page 9 is the relevant part of the definition.

255. space leak with redeclaration of variables
Submitter: John Reppy
Date:	   7/24/90
Version:   0.60
Severity:  major
Problem:
    I think that there is a space leak in the top-level loop/environment.
    If I keep redefining the same identifiers, the amount of live data
    grows, when it should be fairly constant.  I assume that the problem
    is that the top-level symbol table is holding onto something it shouldn't.
Transcript:
Here is a simple demonstration of the space leak (60 bytes/iteration):

  Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.60, 13 July 1990
  val it = () : unit
  - structure S = struct val _ = System.Unsafe.CInterface.gc 1 end;

  [Major collection... 98% used (516680/526692), 610 msec]
  structure S :
    sig
    end
  - structure S = struct val _ = System.Unsafe.CInterface.gc 1 end;

  [Major collection... 98% used (517100/525980), 550 msec]
  structure S :
    sig
    end
  - structure S = struct val _ = System.Unsafe.CInterface.gc 1 end;

  [Major collection... 98% used (517160/526388), 550 msec]
  structure S :
    sig
    end
  - structure S = struct val _ = System.Unsafe.CInterface.gc 1 end;

  [Major collection... 98% used (517220/526448), 550 msec]
  structure S :
    sig
    end
  - structure S = struct val _ = System.Unsafe.CInterface.gc 1 end;

  [Major collection... 98% used (517280/526508), 540 msec]
  structure S :
    sig
    end

Comment: (appel) This is the top-level line-number information, and
	 is a few bytes per line, regardless of size of defined structures.
Status: fixed in 0.65 (actually, it's now a 48-byte leak)

256. mcopt compiler bug with improper function definition
Submitter: John Mitchell (jcm@iswim.stanford.edu)
Date:      7/24/90
Version:   0.60
Severity:  critical
Problem:
    Compiler bug "r_o in mcopt" raised as a result of improper clausal

259. uncaught exception Match compiling normperv.sml
Submitter:      Richard O'Neill (cmp7130%sys.uea.ac.uk@nsfnet-relay.ac.uk)
Date:		Tue Aug 14 10:04:21 BST 1990
Version:        0.63 (not in 0.62 or earlier)
System:         Sun3/180, SunOS 4.1
Severity:       Critical
Problem:

Version 0.63 has a new bug whereby it cannot compile dbguser/normperv.sml
This prevents creating the '-debug' version.

Transcript:

uncaught exception Match

Comments:

Smlc, version 0.62, created the 680X0 '.mo' files from which a -pervshare
runtime system was built using gcc. This runtime system was then used to build
a normal and then a -debug system (which failed).

I've marked the severity as critical because it is a critical problem for this
version. For me however, its not so critical as I seem to be managing OK with
0.62.
Status: apparently fixed as of 0.75

260. failure to raise overflow
Submitter: David.Tarditi@B.GP.CS.CMU.EDU
Date: Mon, 13 Aug 90 15:43:26 EDT
Version: 0.63?
Problem:
The following program should raise an Overflow exception on all
32-bit 2's complement machines but it doesn't:
-------
fun exp 0 = 1 | exp i = 2 * exp (i-1);

val a = exp 29;
val minint = ~a + ~a;

(* should raise overflow *)

val test = minint div ~1;
-------
An overflow exception was not raised in version 0.59 on a Sun 3 running
Mach emluating 4.3 BSD.  It was raised in version 0.59 on a MicroVax 3
running Mach emulating 4.3 BSD.

Comments:

This is the only case where overflow can occur in division.  It occurs
since MININT = -(MAXINT+1) in 2's complement.  Division of MININT by -1 
causes an overflow.

Status: fixed in 0.64

261. Compiler Bug: abstractBody.abstractType 1 (assumed same as 234)
Submitter:	George Beshers, beshers@sun2.brc.uconn.edu
Date:		Aug 9, 1990
Version:	0.56, sparc
Severity:	Significant
Problem:	Compiler generates
	``Regex.sml:21.17 Compiler Bug: abstractBody.abstractType 1''
		Note: this is somewhat delicate to reproduce.  If you
		break the following into files and start a clean sml
		and do "use Regex.sml;" it consistently generates
		the error.  However, if you *repeat* the use Regex.sml
		it compiles (however I have a lingering suspision about
		the correctness of the code produced...).
		On one occasion I tried "using" all the files in
		sequence and that worked OK, at least the working
		parts of the module did.

		Also I have tried to cut parts of the Regex.sml
		file and reproduce the error but without success.
		In particular, the error is dependent on at least
		some of the code appearing later in the file.

262. Using the LIBRARY with v0.62
Submitter: "Soren P. Christensen" <schristensen@daimi.aau.dk>
Date: Wed, 8 Aug 90 14:28:49 +0200
Problem:
I just tried to build the library found in /dist/ml/LIBRARY.tar.Z and
this fails.  We are using a spark version of 0.62.  I am not dependent
on the Library and the reson I report this is only so that you can use
it in your testing.

I had to make small changes like the definition of the quit function by
means of cleanup.

1)
   There seems to be problems with the exceptions.

---------------
Transcript:
Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.62, 1 August 1990
val it = () : unit
- fn () => (() handle Interrupt=>());
val it = fn : unit -> unit
- exception xx = Interrupt;

std_in:1.7-1.15 Error: unbound variable Interrupt
std_in:1.1-1.15 Error: argument of raise is not an exception
  raised: undef
  in expression:
    raise Interrupt

----------------

2)
   later on it terminates with a runbind, I think this is related to the 
exceptions too.
Comments:
  (1) The Interrupt exception constructor has gone away, and Interrupt
  handling should be replaced by handling the interrupt signal.
  (2) The runbind exception seems to be a genuine bug.

264. No type-explicitness check in nj-sml
Submitter: David Turner <dnt@lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk>
Date: 7/8/90
Version  : SML of NJ 0.56 and 0.59
System   : Sun
Severity : Dunno, but its pretty anti-social

Problem :

   The compiler doesn't seem to check for type explicitness in
   signatures (see section 5.8 and also rule 65 of the ML definition).
   This means many signatures which can never be matched are still
   accepted as valid signatures.

Transcript :

  - signature X = sig type t val x : t type t end;
  signature X =
    sig
      type t
      val x : ?.t
    end

265. strong type variables accepted in exception declarations
Submitter:      Dave Berry, db@lfcs.ed.ac.uk
Date:		Aug  7 1990
Version:        0.56, 0.59
Severity:       Minor (although it presumably means that the type system
		can be broken!)
Problem:        The compiler doesn't reject applicative type variables
		in exception declarations.
Code:           val id: 'a -> 'a =
		  let exception dummy of 'a
		  in fn x => x
		  end;
Transcript:     The above code produces:
		val id = fn : 'a -> 'a

266. uncaught Io exception in use
From: John Reppy
Date: Mon, 6 Aug 90 18:53:48 EDT
System: 0.62
Problem:
I've noticed the following new (I think) bug.  An Io error in use results
in an uncaught exception.

  Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.62, 1 August 1990
  val it = () : unit
  - use "foo";
  [cannot open foo]

  uncaught exception Io "open_in "foo": open failed, No such file or directory"

The problem is that in "use_file" in build/interact.sml (line 307), the
exception Io gets re-raised.  Was this changed for the debugger?
[dbm, 8/30/90] Fixed so that exceptions are handled even for nonterminal
input.

267. sharing again
From: Simon Finn <simon@abstract-hardware-ltd.co.uk>

Version: d64
Problem:
The following program breaks Poly/ML v1.88 and  NJML v0.44a (the most recent version
to which I have access) [breaks d64 as well].
Code:
signature S1 =
sig
  eqtype t
  val x : t

signature S2 =
sig
  structure A : sig end
  structure C : sig structure A : S1 end

          structure B:S2
          sharing A = B.A)  =
struct
  val y = (A.x = B.C.A.x)
end;

Transcript:
Standard ML of New Jersey, Version d64, ? August 1990
val it = () : unit
- signature S1 =
  sig
    eqtype t
    val x : t

Comment:
This program is valid, since structure A shares with B.A which shares with B.C.A,
hence A.t and B.C.A.t must be the same (equality) type. However:

268. import, equality
Submitter:      Jason Fischl <fischl@cpsc.ucalgary.ca>
Date:		April 9, 1990
Version:        0.44
System:         Sparcstation 1
Severity:       major

Problem:       

The module system has a bug in it with regard to equality types (I think).
The following is a pretty concise description of what will cause the bug to
occur.  


Code:           
(*-----------------FILE:  term.sig.sml----------------------*)

signature termsig =
sig

datatype term =
    Const of string
  | Var of string
  | Func of string * term list

end;

(*--------------FILE:  term.sml-------------------------*)

import "term.sig";

functor termFC ():termsig =

struct

datatype term =
    Const of string
  | Var of string
  | Func of string * term list

end;

(*------------FILE: parse_term.sml---------------------------*)

import "term.sig";

functor parse_termFC (structure TERM:termsig) =
struct

open TERM

fun term_nil x = (x:term list) = []

end;

(*---------------------------------------*)

Comments:

I couldn't find any reference to it in the bug reports so I had to assume it
was all new.  It would have been much nicer if the error message had been a bit
more descriptive.  All I knew was that it was a type problem.  There was no
info as to which line the error occurred on or which function or anything
really. 

I would appreciate a reply at some point if you could manage since I am curious
as to the nature of my problem.  Undoubtedly it will get me again!  

Fix:  

In order to fix the problem I had to define the fun term_nil inside the term
functor and then also put it in the termsig signature.  This took me on the
order of 8 hours to figure out!

272. generalizing user bound type variables
Submitter: Elsa
Date: 9/7/90
Version: 0.65
Problem: user bound variables are occurring in the final type of a function.
Code:
   fun f(x) = let val y : 'a -> 'a = x in y y end;
Transcript:     <transcript of session illustrating problem>
   - fun f(x) = let val y : 'a -> 'a = x in y y end;
   val f = fn : ('aU -> 'aU) -> 'a -> 'a   
   - f (fn x: 'a => x);
   std_in:2.1-2.16 Error: operator and operand don't agree (bound type var)
     operator domain: 'aU -> 'aU
     operand:	      'aU -> 'aU

273. generalizing weak variables inside fn abstractions
Submitter: Dave MacQueen
Date: 10/3/90
Version: 0.52 and earlier
Problem: 
  let-bound variables were being generalized with too strong a weak type.
Transcript:
   - val x = fn y => let val f = ref in f end;
   val x = fn : 'a -> '3b -> '3b ref
Comments:
   Second bound type variable should be '2b instead of '3b.
Fix: 
   Added abs field to POLYty constructor to remember abstraction level at
   point where type generalization took place.

274. weakness lost with flex record pattern
Submitter: Colin Meldrum <colin@harlqn.co.uk>
Date: 3/19/90
Version: 0.66
Problem: flex record patterns can cause weakness to be dropped, resulting in
  whole in type system.
Code:
    - val a = 
      let val foo = ref nil
      in
	(fn x as {...} => foo:=[x] | (y,z) => ();
	 foo)
      end

    > val a = ref [] : ('a * 'b) list ref
Comment:
    This is very unsafe and can for example allow the definition of a 'cast'
    function...

    fun cast (x) = ((a := (x,0) :: (!a)); #1(hd (!a)));

276. overriding included value spec
Submitter: Dave Berry (db@lfcs.ed.ac.uk)
Date: 3/22/90
Version: 0.66
Severity: major
Problem:
    If a value spec in an included signature is redefined in the
    including signature, the value identifier keeps the type
    from the included signature, but it is printed as the type
    from the including signature.
Transcript:
      signature Foo1 =
      sig
        val foo: string
      end;

     signature Foo2 =
     sig
       include Foo1
       val foo: bool
     end;

     structure Foo: Foo2 =
     struct
       val foo = true
     end;

    Error: value type in structure doesn't match signature spec
      name: foo
      spec:   string
      actual: bool
Comments:
    Note:  Once I worked out what was going on I was actually grateful,
    because I hadn't realised that the names clashed.  Perhaps it
    would be useful if implementations could warn about such cases?

Severity:       Minor (but, should be easy to fix and I would prefer it fixed)

Problem:        

Using 'local ... in ... end' with structures does not work at the top level,
but does work when wrapped in a 'struct ... end' construct

Code:

     structure Internal = struct val x=1 val y=2 end
  in

     structure Second : sig val y : int end = Internal
  end

281. Import bombs out when it can't find files.
Submitter:      Richard O'Neill (cmp7130%sys.uea.ac.uk@nsfnet-relay.ac.uk)
Date:		Tue Jul 17 11:01:09 BST 1990
Version:        0.59
System:         Sun3, SunOS 4.1
Severity:       You decide...
Problem:

Importing new files (ones which do not already have a '.bin' file) fails (with
an uncaught exception) whilst attempting to import files which do not exist
produces the same unfriendly message.

Transcript:

unix% ls
file.sml
unix% sml
Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.59, 4 June 1990
- import "file";

uncaught exception SystemCall
- import "nofile";

uncaught exception SystemCall
-

Perceived Reason:

The timeFile function in sepcomp/importer.sml believes that the SysIO.mtime
function will raise an Io exeption if it cannot find the file. In fact this
exception is never returned by any of the routines in the SysIO module. When
they encounter a problem they raise the SystemCall exception.

Fix (currently untried):

Option 1:

Change the code for timeFile to trap the SystemCall exeption instead of the
Io exception.

e.g.

<PATCH BEGIN>
*** sepcomp/importer.sml.orig   Fri Jun  1 14:08:02 1990
--- sepcomp/importer.sml        Tue Jul 17 10:29:22 1990
***************
*** 159,165 ****
        in
          SOME sec
        end
!         handle (Io _) => NONE

    fun createBinary(indent, filename,
                   statModule: statModule,
--- 159,165 ----
        in
          SOME sec
        end
!         handle (SystemCall _) => NONE

    fun createBinary(indent, filename,
                   statModule: statModule,

<PATCH END>

Option 2:

Create a new exception SysIO wich the module SysIO raises on failure and trap
that. ( This is to my mind better since SystemCall is a rather wide exception
to be trapping ).

282. 'sharable' & 'pervshare' compilers produce different .bin
Submitter:      Richard O'Neill (cmp7130%sys.uea.ac.uk@nsfnet-relay.ac.uk)
Date: 		Mon Jul 23 10:53:45 BST 1990
Version:        0.60
System:         Sun3/50, SunOS 4.1
Severity:       You decide...
Problem: 
Status: R

The '.bin' files produced by the normal and the '-pervshare' versions of the
compiler are different and each 'version' cannot load the other's '.bin' file
reliably.

Perhaps I have built the two versions differently, but I cannot see how since
they were both built at the same time with the same .mo files (compiled with
the 0.59 batch compiler).

Below is a comprehensive transcript which should help in reproducing the bug,
if it can be reproduced...

283. openread (run.c) checking
Submitter: Peter Weinberger
Date: 8/17/90
Version: ?
Severity: minor
Problem:
    openread() in run.c does not check to see if it runs off the
    end of its allowed space.
Comments:
    in practice, this shouldn't be a problem, since openread() only reads
    the first two or three mo files, which should be smaller than the
    initial heap size.

284. Poor type specification handling in mutually recursive functions.
Submitter:      Richard O'Neill (rmo%sys.uea.ac.uk@nsfnet-relay.ac.uk)
Date:		Tue Aug 14 10:04:21 BST 1990
Version:        0.64, 0.62, 0.56, ...
System:         Sun3/180, SunOS 4.1
Problem:

When processing mutually recursive functions, Sml of NJ's current type
mechanism prefers its own inferred types of functions to those specifically
declared by the user.

Code:
	type 'a foobar = {foo:'a, bar:'a}

	fun Foo (acc : 'a list foobar)  (nil : 'a list) = acc
	  | Foo {foo, bar} (h :: t) = Bar {foo=(h :: foo), bar=bar} t

	and Bar (acc : 'a list foobar)  (nil : 'a list) = acc
	  | Bar {foo, bar} (h :: t) = Foo {foo=foo, bar=(h :: bar)} t

val Foo = fn : 'a list foobar -> 'a list -> 'a list foobar
val Bar = fn : {bar:'a list,foo:'a list} -> 'a list -> 'a list foobar
[closing code.sml]
-
- (* One would expect Foo & Bar to have the SAME type *)

Comments:

The type system seems to be deciding on the type of 'Bar' when it encounters
it in the definition of 'Foo', and then sticking to that. Whilst it checks to
see whether the type in the declaration of foo matches the type it has
inferred, it does not change the 'Foo's type to be in line with its 
declaration.

One can work around the problem by making sure that 'Bar' has the desired type
the first time it is encountered. Thus, if Foo is defined as :-

	fun Foo (acc : 'a list foobar)  (nil : 'a list) = acc
	  | Foo {foo,bar} (h :: t) =
		 Bar ({foo=(h :: foo), bar=bar} : 'a list foobar) t

the correct types result :-
	type 'a  foobar = {bar:'a,foo:'a}
	val Foo = fn : 'a list foobar -> 'a list -> 'a list foobar
	val Bar = fn : 'a list foobar -> 'a list -> 'a list foobar

My (ancient) version of Poly/ML also exhibits the same behaviour.

Status: not a bug; type abbreviations are not new types

 The files loaded in "use.sml" are indeed necessary to reproduce the
 bug. Removing any one of them suppresses that particular occurence of
 the bug, bug, but only shifts the problem.

Fix:
 Perhaps the GC, as suggested by the vanishing nature of
 the bug.

Comments:

[Appel] I tried this on version 0.64 on our dec 5810, and it works fine
(no extraneous "match not exhaustive" messages).  Was yours a profiling
version or something like that?

I tried it on a sun-4 here (version 0.64) and the bug did not show up,
so it's not machine-specific.

290. bin files of share/noshare versions are incompatible
Submitter: Eric Cooper (Eric.Cooper@cs.cmu.edu)
Date: 9/18/90
Version: 0.65
System: ?
Severity: minor
Problem:
    The one problem I still have is that sml-noshare gets an illegal
    instruction when it tries to import a .bin file written by the sharable
    sml, and vice versa.  Also, the .bin files produced by sml-noshare are
    much larger than those produced by sml. For example, compiling
    stream.sig.sml produces the following .bin files:

    -rw-r--r--  1 ecc         2664 Sep 18 13:04 obj/stream.sig.bin

291. floating point on sparc
Submitter: Bernard Sufrin
Date: 9/18/90
Version: 0.56
System: Sparc
Problem:
The ``bad'' functions seem to compile incorrectly on Sparc machines
but ok on 68020 machines. Looks like >=0.0 is compiled wrongly, but the
circumstances are mystifying.  Why does the presence of the pair parameter seem
to be critical (offset calculation in the machine-specific code-generator?).

Code:

(* try ??bad(0.0, 0.0) (~0.2) *)

    fun  bad (x, y)  l =
       if l >= 0.0 then  x else bad(x+l, y) (~l);
    fun  alsobad (x, y)  l =
       if l>0.0  orelse  l=0.0 then  x else alsobad(x+l, y) (~l);
    fun  good (x, y)  l =
       if 0.0 <= l then  x else good(x+l, y) (~l);
    fun  alsogood x y  l =
       if l >= 0.0 then  x else alsogood(x+l) y (~l);

Problem:        Compilation of sml with interpretor and debug packages fails

Transcript:     command: makeml -decstation bsd -i -debug

Comments:

Running the compilation without the -i works on both platforms.
If the interpretor and debugger are truly incompatible, then
makeml should flag it.
(apt) They aren't incompatible: the interpreter was broken.

Status: fixed as of 0.88, but interpreter breaks elsewhere on debugger code.

293. debug problems
Submitter:     	Todd Knoblock, todd@eecs.umich.edu
Date: 		26 September 1990
Version:	SML 0.65, emacs 18.55.1
System:		Decstation under ultrix and Sun sparc under sunos
Severity:	error message: minor, no output: critical

Synopsis:

I am having two problems with the emacs debug package.

The first is quite minor: on start-up on a non-x-display (like my
terminal at home), emacs reports the following error when loading
sml-init: file mode specification error:
(void-variable-x-button-m-left).

The second is more serious.  When sending to the sml process, I do not
get output until I move (c-x o/c-x b) into the process buffer.  For example, 
if I have this in a buffer

fun f(0) = 1
  | f(x) = x*(f (x-1));

and type c-c c-c, then if sml has not been run before, emacs
will bring up a window, and start it properly.  However, the
only output is 

Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.65, 10 September 1990
val it = () : unit
- emacsInit (); cd "/afs/engin.umich.edu/user/t/o/todd/";
[opening /tmp/sml.tmp.a02351]


Once I move into the buffer, then I get the rest of the output:


val f = fn : int -> int
[closing /tmp/sml.tmp.a02351]

If sml is already running, and the window is not visible, then
sending to the buffer does not cause it to become visible.

Comments:

If I disable the debugging code, by removing the two "hooks"
in sml-init, then the interface works as in the past.  I am
running emacs version 18.55.1, and have tried it on two platforms:
decstation under ultrix, and a sparc under sunos.  Finally, it 
appears that the file outdent.el is redundant now, and could be
removed from the distribution.

Comments: [apt, 2/1/93]
These bugs aren't fixed.
The first is just a trivial error message.
As to the second: we don't really guarantee that c-c c-c and similar
emacs interface tricks will work with the debugger.

You could "not a bug" these if you want, though they should get addressed
eventually -- I deliberately didn't spend time on minor emacs-related
problems last summer.

297. Bits.lshift on Sun4

1990
System:         Sun4, both SunOS and Mach
Severity:       minor
Problem:

1. Calls to Bits.lshift with constant arguments that should raise
Overflow cause a compiler error message instead.

2. With non-constant arguments, Bits.lshift expressions that should
raise Overflow don't.

Code:

(1)	Bits.lshift(1,30);

(2)	fun lshift (x, y) = Bits.lshift (x, y);
	lshift (1, 30);
	lshift (1000000, 64);

SIGILL code 0x2

Comments:

[Cooper] The number of bits to shift is evidently being reduced modulo 32.

[jhr] The lshift operation does not raise Overflow (Andrew's
decision).  I'll look at the other problem.

[jhr] When there is a compiler bug (at least in the backend), the
state of the system gets screwed up in such a way that the system core
dumps.  Is it possible to do a better job of cleaning up when a
compiler bug is detected?  An example is (on 0.66/sparc)

  - Bits.lshift (1, 30);
  Error: Compiler bug: [SparcCM.ashr]
  - ();
  SIGILL code 0x2

[appel]  I don't see where the Definition of Standard ML says that lshift
should raise Overflow!

  0.66 has a SIGEMT problem on SPARC's, on hitting ^C (sometimes). Will

 Also from Mike Crawley <mjc@abstract-hardware-ltd.co.uk>, in 0.73:
  I have been able to repeat the following

  sml while it is busy can sometimes crash it.

removing any of the enclosing structures makes the bug go away.  This works

Well, after a month of messing about with other things, I finally got arround
to getting sml working the NeXT (my NeXT arrived and so I could work on it at
home). I'll tell you the problem and give my diffs. 

The problem was that, among the various load commands needed in the
executable's header, one is needed to load the c shared library, and this was
ommited (since previously programs weren't *forced* into using the shared
libraries).  Since the load command is always exactly the same, I did a
ghastly hack and substituted the thing in as a constant (array stuffed with
the right hex numbers). This isn't quite the cleanest thing to do, but I was
only concerned with getting it to work for me. (Yeah, I know, I'm lazy...)

Anyway, diffs follow, and it at least it works now...

310. HP Cache flush problem
Submitter:      Nick Rothwell

System:         HP9000/380 (a /300 with go-faster 68040 option)
Severity:       Critical for this system; fairly major overall
Problem:        Bombs with random bus errors or other traps on 68040-based
		HP machines. The build sequence runs, but not much else.
		Maybe it's a problem with saved images or something
Code:           <almost anything>

Fix:

From: Andy Norman <ange@hplb.hpl.hp.com>

A solution to your problem is to change the caching to 'writethrough' instead
of 'copyback' on the data region of the dumped sml image. i.e.

  chatr -Cd sml

This is documented in the file /etc/newconfig/ReleaseNotes and on the man page
for chatr.

Hope this helps... a bit...

I'm intrigued by your mail about write-through.  Perhaps we can
still use write-back, if we flush the cache whenever the
garbage collector (etc.) moves code around.  There
is a provision in the runtime system to do this for machines
like the MIPS where the i-cache does not track updates to the
data.  Could this be the problem?  (grep for FLUSH in the runtime)

313. poor error message
Submitter: John Reppy (jhr@cs.cornell.edu)
Date: Thu, 20 Jun 91
Version: 0.69
System: 
Severity: minor
Problem: 
I tripped across a poor error message last night.  Assume we have a 7 line
file "xxx.sml" with the following contents:

  (* 1 *)  fun foo () = let
  (* 2 *)        fun bar () = let
  (* 3 *)              val z = 1
  (* 4 *)              in
  (* 5 *)                z
  (* 6 *)              end
  (* 7 *)  val w = 1

The error being that we forgot the body of foo's let.  The error message
that SML/NJ gives is:
Code: 
Transcript: 
  Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.69, 3 April 1991
  val it = () : unit
  - use "xxx.sml";
  [opening xxx.sml]
  xxx.sml:7.19 Error: syntax error found at EOF
  [closing xxx.sml]
  - 
Comments: 
When foo is in the middle of a 1000 line file, figuring out the source
of the error becomes quite hard.  If the error message had the line range, 
it would be a lot better.
Fix: perhaps allow specification in mlyacc that a three-token
     insertion should be tried; in this case  "in 0 end"
     Same approach could fix bug 206.

Comments:	Is it really safe to allow rebinding of product type ? This
		operator must be parsed as special case anyway, as product type
		operator does not obey the same syntax as user definable type

		As a comment, I would prefer the compiler to infer automatically

The first argument of blast_write and the argument of blast_read
should be of type outstream and instream respectively.  In system.sig,
they're given types 'outstream * 'a -> unit and 'instream -> 'a making
them polymorphic.  I'm sure there's a reason for this, but I don't
know what it is.

Comments: 
>From Lal George:
The bug seems simple; checkopen.test was complaining if anything other
than vals, exceptions, or structures were defined within a structure! The
problem was only visible if this other thing (e.g., a type declaration)
came before test had a chance to raise NotStale on something else. A 
revised version of test is as follows:

Fix: 
    let fun test (s:symbol) =
	    case Env.look newenv s
	      of VARbind(VALvar{access=PATH(v'::_),...}) =>
		  if v' = v then raise NotStale else ()
	       | CONbind(DATACON{rep=VARIABLE(PATH(v'::_)),...}) =>
		  if v' = v then raise NotStale else ()
	       | STRbind(STRvar{access=PATH(v'::_),...}) =>
		  if v' = v then raise NotStale else ()
	       | _ => ()
Status: Fixed -- however, the fix in 0.69 adds another arm to the
case after the CONbind:

               | CONbind(DATACON{rep=VARIABLEc(PATH(v'::_)),...}) =>
                  if v' = v then raise NotStale else ()

  Illegal instruction

Comments:
  This happen on all the machines mentioned above (nearly
  always via an illegal instruction).

This is clearly a problem with the new CPS stuff, but I'd like to
again point out the other problem: code generation bugs, such as
this one or the shift bug on the sparc, cause the system to get into
some kind of corrupted state, which causes a core dump on the next
top-level definition.  I think that there needs to be a catch-all
exception handler wrapped around code generation stuff, which will
restore things to a reasonable state.
  - John

The problem with System.Unsafe.Weak is that John forgot to make it an
abstraction rather than a Structure.  If this is fixed, haven no longer
dumps core; I would hope shamash wouldn't get wedged either, though I don't
intend to try the experiment!

Andrew

Trying to reproduce a bug that occurs on haven in 67, I typed

open System.Unsafe.Weak;
strong 1;

This should give a typechecking error, but on haven, it causes a Bus Error.
It looks like on shamash it wedges the machine!
I'm investigating further on other machines.

339. type = allowed
Submitter: Nick Rothwell (nick@lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk)
Date: Nov 8 1990
Version: 
System: 
Severity: minor
Problem: SML/NJ allows the following code
Code: 
   signature S = sig type = end;
Transcript: 
Comments: 
Here, "=" is clearly not standing for the equality predicate (even though
it's not being rebound), so this is illegal.

The status of something like

  signature S =
    sig
      structure T: sig ... end sharing type T.t = T.*
    end;

is less clear. "*" is not allowed as a TyCon, but "T.*" presumably is (even
though no matching signature for "T" would be syntactically possible to
write).

Sender: David.Tarditi@b.gp.cs.cmu.edu
Status: RO

Here are some answers to the questions about parsing in SML/NJ raised
by Nick Rothwell.  First, the processing of infix operators is handled
by an operator precedence parser after parsing is finished.  The ML-Yacc
grammar essentially allows allow any string of legal identifiers in certain
places; the operator precedence parser sorts it out later.  (As a side note,
this make syntactic error correction much harder).  Yes, this means
that we don't have a "pure" LALR grammar, but I don't see any way anyone
could have one with the precedence scheme used in ML.  

The parser deals with "=" and "*" by always regarding them as reserved words.
To put it another way, the lexer always returns separate tokens for these
values.   This reduces our problem to deciding where exactly "=" and "*"
should be permitted to be used in place of identifiers.

The following rules sort this out:

"*" can always be used in place of an identifier, except in the syntactic
    class "TyCon"

"=" can only be used in place of an identifier in an expression.
    Since it cannot be rebound, it cannot be used as an identifier
    in pattern.

As Nick Rothwell has pointed out, there are some mistakes in SML/NJ
where these rules are violated.  To summarize the problems found so
far:

(1) Allows * to be used as TyCon in type specifications.  This is clearly
    illegal SML (see p.  13 of the Definition).

Example:
	sig
	  type *
        end

(2) Allows = to be used as TyCon in type specifications.  Since this
    isn't the equality predicate, this is wrong.

Example:
	sig
	   type =
	end

(3) Doesn't allow "*" to be used as a record label.  This is clearly
    allowed, since "*" is just an identifier.

Example
	{* = 5}

All of these can be fixed by some minor changes to the grammar using by
SML/NJ, without making the grammar ambiguous.

With regard to parsing examples:

(1)  This is complicated, but not ambiguous.  

   val x = {A=B=C=D=E, B=((X=Y), {X=Y}, X=Y), X=Y};

binds  x to a record with fields A,B, and X.  Field A is set to the boolean
value of ((B=C)=D)=E),  Field B is a tuple of type bool * {X:bool} * bool,
and Field X is set to the value of Y.   Thus:

     val B=1 and C=1 and D=true and E=true and X=1 and Y=1
     val x = {A=B=C=D=E,B=((X=Y), {X=Y}, X=Y), X=Y}

gives:

     val x = {A=true,B=(true,{X=1},true),X=1) :
	    {A:bool,B : bool * {X : int} * bool, X : int}
      

(2) This is legal; the Definition says nothing about rebinding the
    precedence of =.  It won't typecheck though, since function types
    are not equality types.

   nonfix =
   val x = = and y = {A= =(=, =), B = =}

(3) This should be illegal, but isn't.  It shows that SML is
    inherently ambiguous for any fixed lookahead k.

   nonfix =
   fun f x = = | f y = case y of 1 => = | 2 => = | f z = =

    The reason is best illustrated with this simpler case

        fun f x = case y of 1 => 1 | f z = 3

    The "| f z = 3" phrase should go with "fun f x", not with
    the case statement clause.  A parser cannot decide this, however,
    until it sees that the "=" is not an "=>".  However, z can be an
    arbitrarily complex pattern, so for fixed lookahead k we can choose
    some pattern that requires lookahead of k+1 tokens.

    There isn't much you can do about this, short of changing the language
    definition.

    The following variant is legal, by the way:

   nonfix =
   fun f x = = |00 stlouis8913372 "" \r\d in:--in: nuucp word: nuucpNUUCP
to the problem of infixes in signatures making
separate parsing and typehcecking passes difficult, it is already
impossible (I think) to separate the parsing and typechecking
completely.  The infix status of an identifier cannot be determined
without the use of static semantics information.

You could separate the passes as:

(1) parsing
(2) typechecking plus parsing of infix identifiers

if you insist on this kind of division.

Comments: 
If I can compare ref f with ref f1, why can't I compare A(ref f) with

Also, from Chet Murthy:
I want to define a datatype, with constructors/destructors, for which
the system can be forced to not provide an equality.  I do not think
this is possible.  Here is the application:

The Nuprl term-type is one for which constructors/destructors are
crucial.  But the term-type is defined in such a way that alpha-equal
variants are not represented identically.  So lambda(x.x) and
lambda(y.y) are not the same structure.  So structural equality will
fail on them.

So we define alpha-equality, which respects this equivalence.  But the
problem is that we do not want to discard structural equality
completely.  That is, if we were to add a new disjunct to the Nuprl
term-type:

datatype Term = .......... | Bogus of int -> int

then Term would not be an eq-type, and structural equality would be
inadmissible.  But sometimes I DO want structural equality, like in
hash-consing (and I'm not sure where else, but I don't want to rule
that out).  So I don't want to give it up right now.  So it would be
nice to define a structure which exported a datatype for the
term-type, an equality function which happened to be defined as
structural equality, but in which the term-type was NOT an eqtype.  Is
this possible?

Here is my try - and the problem:

signature ASIG = sig
type t
datatype DNE = D of int | Bogus of t
val op == : DNE * DNE -> bool
infix 4 ==
end;

abstraction A:ASIG = struct
type t = int
datatype DNE = D of int | Bogus of t
fun == (a,b) = (a = b)
end;

If I run (A.D 5)=(A.D 6) the system will happily run it.  But I want
the system to complain about DNE not being an eq-type.

This isn't possible, is it?

344. explicit type variable problem
Submitter: Dave MacQueen (dbm@research.att.com)
Date: Mar 30 1991
Version: through 0.74
Code: 
structure C : sig val f : 'a -> 'a end =
struct

  exception E
  fun foo(k:'a option -> 'a) : 'a = k(NONE)
  fun bar(x:'a option) (y: 'a) = raise E

  fun f (e) =  (* using (e:'a) as argument works *)
      foo (fn l => let fun g (x : 'a) = bar l x
		    in g e
		   end)

end
Comments: 
The rule for "scoping" explicit type variables like the 'a that
appears in the definition of g is purely syntactic (i.e. doesn't
take type checking, and its associated unifications, into account).
Each explicit type variable is associated with with a particular
val/fun declaration, and it should be generalized at that declaration,
if possible.  In this case 'a is associated with the "fun g" declaration,
and we might annotate the definition of f accordingly:

  fun f (e) =  (* using (e:'a) as argument works *)
      foo (fn l => let fun{'a} g (x : 'a) = bar l x
		    in g e
		   end)

This means that the only legal place to generalize 'a would be at the
definition of g.  However, in this case the expression "bar l x"
forces the type of l to be 'a option, meaning that 'a occurs in
the type of the outer lambda bound variable l.  This prevents the
generalization of 'a at "fun g", so there is a conflict.  Thus the
program is not legal, but there should have been an error message
about not being able to generalize 'a at "fun g", where it is
syntactically scoped.  I'll put in a fix to detect this situation
and generate such an error message.

345. export should return a code and have different type
Date: Nov 8, 1990
Severity: minor
Problem: 
How come exportFn is string * (string list * string list -> unit) -> unit
instead of string * (string list * string list -> int) -> 'a   ?

I was actually suggesting two things: the function passed as
argument to exportFn should return an exit status and
exportFn itself should "return" 'a rather than unit
because it doesn't return.

Of course, making exportFn's argument return exit status
might break existing programs that use it; I don't know whether
that's important or not at this stage of the game.

If you want to write unix commands in ML, it's important to
be able to set a return code.

Comments: there is, of course, an "exit" function available for this purpose.

Status: suggestion (not a bug)

350. fvalbind rewrite rule
Submitter: Nick Rothwell (nick@lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk)
Date: 12 Feb 1991
Version: 
System: 
Severity: minor
Problem: 
Referring to the definition of the `fun' derived form (defn. V4 p68):
there's a rewriting rule for fvalbind's looking like

          <op>var atpat.11 ... atpat.1n <: ty> = exp.1
          <op>var atpat.21 ... atpat.2n <: ty> = exp.2

          <op>var atpat.m1 ... atpat.mn <: ty> = exp.m
                <and fvalbind>

This implicitly suggests that all the function result type constraints
(whichever present) have to be the same. But, this is a *syntactic*
constraint (we're dealing with derived forms, not elaboration rules).
Certainly they have to elaborate to the same type, but surely they may be
distinct syntactically? The above rule outlaws the following

        local
          type INT = int
        in
          fun f 0 : int = 0
            | f 1 : INT = 1
        end;

354. SIGILL bug on SPARC
Submitter: John Reppy (jhr@cs.cornell.edu)
Date: June 18 1991
Version: 0.69
System: SPARC
Severity: major
Problem: 
One of our alpha testers encountered a strange Overflow exception in
eXene.  Upon closer examination it turns out that the problem really
is an illegal instruction exception (SIGILL), and that modifications
made to support MACH on the SPARC caused SIGILL to be mapped to Overflow.

Further examination demonstrates that the bug is neither an eXene bug
or CML bug, but is a bug in SML/NJ.  After a lot of testing I've managed
to produce a small (<100 lines) example program, which will cause the
bug on both the SPARC and DECstation 3100.  The fact that this program
uses the timer interrupts to do thread switching is key; if you turn
the signals off, then the bug does not appear.  I also note that the bug
does not seem to appear in my version of 0.68 (0.67 + my changes for
the unsafe callcc); thus I suspect that it was introduced by the
changes made for supporting FP registers.  The example program is
included below; to produce the bug, run the function "go."  It usually
takes about 3-5 minutes to fail on a SPARCstation-1.  For example, the
following run took 2.5 min:

356. size of images generated by import too large
Submitter: Jawahar Malhotra (malhotra%metasoft@bbn.com)
Date: Jan 29, 1991
Version: 
System: 
Severity: 
Problem: 
I recently redesigned a large system so that I could use separate
compilation. I experienced an increase in heap size of
close to 100%. This was a little disturbing and so I investigated
a little. To explain the problem consider the following example:

Say my system consists of 4 modules: A, B, C, D. 
Every functor is in a separate file as is every signature.
To link, I execute 'use "link.sml"'.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(* link.sml *)

import "a";
import "b";
import "c";
import "d";

structure A = A();
structure B = B(A);
structure C = C(A);
structure D = D(structure X = B
		structure Y = C);
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The files are as follows:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(* a.sml *)

import "a.sig";

functor A() = 
...
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(* b.sml *)

import "a.sig";
import "b.sig";

functor B (X:ASIG) : BSIG = 
...
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(* c.sml *)

import "a.sig";
import "c.sig";

functor C (X:ASIG) : CSIG = 
...
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

...

Building the system as shown above led to LARGE heap sizes (and images
generated by exportML). I suspected that this was due to the
duplicated imports of the same signature file by many sml files.  
For example, "a.sig" is imported by "a.sml", "b.sml", "c.sml". 

To verify this, I wrote a function called "smartImport" which uses
"use" to load files. It maintains an environment of files already
loaded and avoids duplicate loading of files (code appears at end of
message). I then replaced "import" by "smartImport" in all my source
files and rebuilt. I found that the resulting image size was much
smaller. 

The following results were obtained using an actual system with
approx. 40 modules. For both cases, exactly the same source code was
loaded and an image exported using "exportML".

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
						exportML file size
							(bytes)

Without smartImport (regular sep. comp.)	5799968
With smartImport 				3063840
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is quite a significant saving. I would eventually like to have an
improved "import" command; one that can avoid duplicated loading of files.
I'm not so sure the technique I have used (i.e. using file names to
determine if a file has already been loaded) is a general error-free
solution.

A combination of file name and file modification time may be better.
So whenever "import" loads a file, it records the file name and the
file modification time. The next time it encounters this file, it
compares the saved modification time with the file's actual
modification time. If the file is newer, it reloads the file else it
skips the file. 

Has anyone else had such experiences with separate compilation? Any
other suggestions for how to keep the heap size down?

360. bad error message when missing functor argument

Version: 
System: 
Severity: minor
Problem: 
	Here's another bug report, this one relatively minor.  The problem
arises as follows.  I have a build file which imports a bunch of files and
then applies a bunch of functors to build the program.  I changed one of the
functors to take a parameter where it formerly had none.  But I forgot to
change the build file to plug in an argument.  Here's what I get:

It gives a reasonable message, then an unreasonable one.  I've noticed
versions of this where the "compiler bug" is "tyC" (or something close to
that).

My suspicion is that it has to do with the awful declaration-as-argument
syntax for functor applications ....

Problem: 
The example of how to build a lexer is wrong (line 348), because the
input file gets opened multiple times.

        val lexer = Mlex.makeLexer (fn x => input(open_in "f",x))

should be

        val lexer = Mlex.makeLexer (inputc (open_in "f"))

365. fixed size of tuples causes bug
Submitter:      Jawahar Malhotra
Date:		29 May 91
Version:        0.62
System:         SUN SPARC, SUN OS 4.1
Severity:       major
Problem:        A labeled record can have no more than 100 fields
Comments:
I was browsing the typechecker code (typing/typecheck.sml) and I
noticed a constant "val maxFieldNum = 100," which I assume limits
the number of slots a tuple is allowed to have.  It would be best
to avoid such hard-coded limits, but, if they must exist, they
probably should be localized into a single structure, to allow
easy modifications.

Version 0.69 of SML/NJ:

When compiling the following code, an "uncaught exception Subscript"
occurs.  If the number of elements in the tuple is reduced to 100 from
110, the exception no longer occurs.

Problem: 
The two modules that follow were tested independantly and they both worked.
The problem comes when they try and communicate. I have cut the modules
down as much as possible and hope that the exact problem is clear to you
(as it isn't to me!).

I've been playing around with the two modules and found that they work okay in
conjunction with eachother when the datatype node_seq in the NODE_SEQ
module is not recursive.
Code:

	type Sequence
	datatype Hierarchy = EmptyHierarchy | Addlevel of Sequence * Hierarchy

functor Hierarchy(structure Node_Seq : NODE_SEQ) : HIERARCHY =

	type Sequence = Node_Seq.node_seq
	datatype Hierarchy = EmptyHierarchy | Addlevel of Sequence * Hierarchy

366. lookahead
Submitter: Dave Berry <db@lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk>
Date: Jan 26 1991
Version: ?
Severity: minor
Problem: 
If I type the following simple program to either SML/NJ or Poly/ML, I
get some interesting behaviour:

(lookahead std_in; lookahead std_in);

(I haven't tried this with Poplog ML or Edinburgh ML because they're only
installed on our Suns, which have crashed.)

If I give this program the input

a

it returns the string "a".  This is the behaviour I expect - the first
call looks at the next character but doesn't affect the state of the
stream, so the next call finds the same character.

(If you try this you'll have to type a semi-colon after the program
finishes, because the compiler will read your input.)

However, if I give the following input to the program

<CTRL-D>a

then it still returns "a".  In other words the first call consumes the
end-of-stream marker, changing the state of the stream.  It's not at all
clear to me that this is the desired behaviour.  It's this behaviour
that results in the problem with end_of_stream that I mentioned some weeks
ago, because (end_of_stream i) is defined as (lookahead i = "").

I suggest that lookahead should never change the state of a stream, even
when it finds an end-of-stream marker on an interactive stream.  This
may require some extra state information in the implementation of a 
stream, but that shouldn't be visible to the user.  This would give
more consistent behaviour, and would solve the problem with end_of_stream.
It also means that I could get rid of the InStream and OutStream types
in the Edinburgh library, making it quite a bit simpler to use (and
maintain).

Some interactive programs do have to consume end-of-stream markers on
interactive streams.  This can be done by calling read at the appropriate
place, perhaps using a function like the following:

fun consumeEOS i =
      if InStream.interactive i then
	if end_of_stream i then read i else ""
      else raise NotInteractive i;

The only problem that I can see with this approach is that a program that
tests for end_of_stream won't necessarily consume the end-of-stream marker
with an explicit read, which means that the compiler will read it and exit.
I can think of a couple of ways that an implementation could avoid this.
The first is to consume an end-of-stream marker before reading a new
program, thus requiring the user to type CTRL-D twice to exit (which might
be safer anyway).  The second is to require the user to call a specific
exit function to exit the compiler.  The third is to treat std_in specially,
and to mark when an end-of-stream marker is encountered by a user calling
lookahead as opposed to the compiler calling lookahead.  I don't know
how easy this would be to implement.

To summarise, this gives a consistent behaviour to lookahead, and seems a
far neater way of solving the end_of_stream problem than my previous
suggestion.

371. intmap bug
Submitter: Chet Murthy (murthy@cs.cornell.edu)
Date: 13 Jun 91
Version: 
System: 
Severity: 
Problem: I was using intmap to implement a hash table, and I found what appears
to be a bug.  
Code: 
(* requires intmap.sig and intmap.sml to be loaded
   To see the bug, run "try 477 trace;" and "try 476 trace;"
   the variable longtrace is bound to an even longer trace.

   Each will, for each N in the list, add (N,CTR) to the
   intmap, and then increment CTR.

   Then each will dump the intmap with intMapToList, and compare
   the cardinality of the domain (computed by getting the first
   projection of each pair in the graph given by intMapToList and
   and uniquifying it) to the actual length of the list returned
   by intMapToList.

   The function repeated will print out all the pairs (N,V) such
   that N appears more than once in the graph.  Try
   "repeated 476 trace" and observe that the output is empty,
   whereas "repeated 477 trace" produces "[(29,476),(29,316)]"
   meaning that both pairs showed up in the trace.
   *)

(* splits a list into the first N elts and the tail *)
fun chopList(0,l) = (nil,l)
  | chopList(n,h::t) =
    let val (m,l') = chopList(n-1,t) in
        (h::m,l')
    end

fun uniquize nil = nil
|   uniquize (h::t) = if member h t then uniquize t else h::(uniquize t)

  fun collect f l = fold List.@ (map f l) nil

fun runTo n l =
    let val (pref,_) = chopList(n,l)
        val ctr = ref 0

end

    fun op mod(a:int,b:int):int = a-(a div b)*b

(see boot/perv.sml).  The "*" in mod is causing the overflow.  You could
use quot and rem, but they may not give you the answer you want:

The easiest way to reproduce the Runbind exception is to try to load
the portable version of the SML library into SML 0.69. I've also had
it occur when I was doing something with returning options, but that

379. redundant patterns
Submitter: John Reppy (jhr@cs.cornell.edu)
Date: Jan 25 1991
Problem: 
I would like to suggest that the compiler reject redundant patterns as
errors (possibly with a flag to generate only warnings to preserve
compatibility with "The Definition").  The reason for this change is
that it will force the user to deal with potential errors (warning
messages usually get buried in the output).  Often, a redundant pattern
is the result of a mis-spelled constructor name, and so is actually an
error (there is an example of this in the 0.67 version of the debugger).
Transcript: 
I noticed the following redundant pattern warnings while compiling
0.67.  The debugger ones are definitely an error.

381. saving registers for signal handler continuation
Submitter: Andrew Tolmach (apt@princeton.edu)
Date: 14 may 1991
Version: 0.69
System: 
Severity: major
Problem: 
Andrew Tolmach discovered an interesting bug, which he and I traced
further.  Summary:

At a heap-limit check (typically an add-to-limit-causing-overflow),
there are two kinds of general-purpose registers:

1.  Live Pointers or Tagged Integers.  These get a 1 in the register mask.
2.  Dead Pointers, Live Untagged Integers, or anything else. 
     These get a 0.

Thus, a 0 in the mask does NOT indicate "dead."  Registers with a 1
in the mask should be forwarded (if pointers) by the G.C., and
registers with a 0 should be preserved unchanged.

Unfortunately, the function "make_ml_sigh_arg" was not preserving the 
0-in-the-mask registers, so that the string-creation function create_s
was losing a register if a signal occurred.
Code:

Is having ml_sigh_arg preserve all registers the right thing to do ?
Maybe we should enforce the invariant that a 0 in the mask
indicates "dead" ?   The argument for doing this is that it
makes signal handling cheaper in both time and space.  Right now,
make_ml_sigh_arg only has to save the number of used registers.
It scans each bit in the mask to determine which registers to
save until the remainder of the mask is 0, so it takes less time also,
if live registers tend to be the lower numbered registers (as they do
with the current register allocator).

The argument for not doing this is that is allows us to do
"representation analysis", i.e. place untagged integers in
registers across procedure boundaries.  I don't know what
the performance gain from this will be.

   Dave

From: Andrew Appel <appel@Princeton.EDU>
John Reppy has found that signal-handling overhead isn't too bad
(3% for 20-millisecond timer interrupts on a SPARC), and saving
a few extra register shouldn't make a huge difference.
I would certainly hate to rule out passing untagged integers across
procedure boundaries.

384. signal handler never re-installed
Submitter:    Manuel Fahndrich (mf39@andrew.cmu.edu)
Date:         6/4/91
Version:      0.66 0.67
System:       DECstation 3100 (Mach and BSD UNIX 4.3)
Problem:      The signal handlers only get called the first time they are
              installed. Once setHandler(signal, NONE) is executed and then
              setHandler(signal, SOME handler), the signal is ignored.
              Tested on signals (SIGIO, SIGINT, SIGALRM)

Transcript:   fun ioh (_, k) = (print "SIGIO\n"; k);
              System.Signals.setHandler (System.Signals.SIGIO, SOME ioh);
              <ok, this works>
              System.Signals.setHandler (System.Signals.SIGIO, NONE);
              <ok, ignored>
              System.Signals.setHandler (System.Signals.SIGIO, SOME ioh);
              <wrong, still ignored!!!>

Comment:      The inqHandler returns the correct handler function at the end.
[jgm] The following code really exercises the bug:

  open System.Signals;
  setHandler(SIGINT, NONE);
  inqHandler(SIGINT);
  (* core dumps *)

Code for setHandler and inqHandler is simple enough to figure that the
bug is probably in the code generator -- it's broken on Mach and Irix,
so the OS is not to blame.  Also, ripping the signal handling code
in perv.sml out and compiling it on top of the pervasives makes the
bug go away.

(1) Suppose we do :

open System.Signals;
open System.Timer;
val setitimer = System.Unsafe.CInterface.setitimer;
fun setTimer msec =  (setitimer(0,TIME{sec=0,usec=1000*msec}, 
				   TIME{sec=0,usec=1000*msec}));
setHandler(SIGALRM,SOME(fn (_,k) => (print "hi!\n";k)));
setTimer 500;

This will print hi! twice a second (on cs or elan) or (roughly speaking) 
when return is hit (on haven), more or less as expected.

(2) Now suppose we do :

setHandler(SIGALRM,NONE); 
setHandler(SIGALRM,SOME(fn (_,k) => (print "lo!\n";k)));

On all machines, this has no visible effect; that is, lo! is not printed.

(3) But if we then do:

System.Unsafe.CInterface.c_function "enablesig" (3,true);

we do start seeing lo! just as we saw hi! before.


Finally, and most excitingly, if we do (1) followed by:

setHandler(SIGALRM,NONE); 
inqHandler SIGALRM;

we get the following results:

on haven and k2 (both versions):

Bus Error

on elan:

- Fixed up unaligned data access for pid 16679 (sml) at pc 0x417ed0

385. SIGHUP, SIGQUIT, SIGTERM ignored sometimes
Submitter: Mark Foster (mark@central.cis.upenn.edu)
Date: Nov 15 1990
Version: 0.66
System: 
Severity: minor
Problem: 
It appears that some signals get ignored when they shouldn't.
In particular, SIGHUP SIGQUIT and SIGTERM don't get properly delivered
when the parent process of sml exits in certain ways.  As a result,
the sml process remains, sometimes dormant, and sometimes in a spin
loop (continuous select() calls, trying to output a message, but it
can't because it's psuedo tty is "gone").

The easiest way we've found to demonstrate the problem is via telnet

	% telnet me
	Trying 127.0.0.1 ...
	Connected to LOCALHOST.UPENN.EDU.
	Escape character is '^]'.

	(login stuff deleted)
	% sml
	Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.66, 15 September 1990
	val it = () : unit
	-

now, escape back to telnet, then close the connection
	^]
	telnet> c

the sml process does not exit.

WORKAROUNDS:

We have two possible workarounds to this problem.  Fundamentally, the
output that's trying to happen probably needs to be fixed.  Either
to detect when it cannot successfully output or to just give up at some
point.  The following two approaches don't do fix the problem, they just 
bandaid around it.  Both methods "cure" the problems we've been 
experiencing.

Method 1:
Change runtime/signal.c to disallow redefining of the signals used to
shutdown a child process

>                                     SETSIG (sig, sig_handler, SIGMASK);
>                                   }
>               break;
234c238,241
<           SETSIG (sig, sig_handler, SIGMASK);
---
>         if ((sig != SIGQUIT) &&
>             (sig != SIGHUP) && (sig != SIGTERM)) {
>             SETSIG (sig, sig_handler, SIGMASK);
>           }


Method 2:
Change boot/perv.sml to not attempt to output a message on quit

% diff perv.sml.orig perv.sml
1871,1873c1871
<     fun quit s _ = (
<         output(std_err, s); output(std_err, " (no coredump)\n");

I've seen this effect, but I never thought about it enough
to realize what was going on.  His first solution is an
awkward way to say the ML can't handle SIGHUP, SIGQUIT
and SIGTERM; I like to avoid that.  His second solution is
better; but there probably should be a warning somewhere
abut the problems with SIGHUP.

I think that this problem is a bug in the way select works.  If you do
a select on a closed file, it fails with EBADF; I think it should do the
same if the ptty has gone away.  But we live in an imperfect world, so
I recommend the following fix:

Replace the function quit (at the end of perv.sml) with the following
code:

    fun quit s _ = let val msg = (s ^ " (no coredump)\n\000")
	  in
	  (* use write, since IO.output will block if we've lost the ptty *)
	    System.Unsafe.SysIO.write(2, System.Unsafe.cast msg, size msg)
	      handle _ => ();
	    System.Unsafe.CleanUp.shutdown()

Comments:
  Interestingly enough, this doesn't seem to happen when you have a unary
  type abbreviation like
	type 'a bogus = int

  The problem seems to boil down to WHEN you project through abbreviations
  (i.e. when you do the "macro" expansion).  There seems to be at least two
  possibilities, project through before a unification containing this type,
  or attempt to unify with this type and project through only if this fails.
  As long as every argument to the type abbreviation also appears in the
  expanded form, the two are equivalent.  When an argument DOESN'T appear in
  expanded form, the second approach (which is the approach currently
  being used) causes problems.  As is evident in the above example, it
  causes the typechecker to unify things which should not be unified.

  The following code from unify.sml (in unifyTy) is where the problem is:
	   | (CONty(tycon1, args1), CONty(tycon2, args2)) =>
	       if eqTycon(tycon1, tycon2)
----->	       then unifyArgs(args1, args2)
	       else (unifyTy(reduceType ty1, ty2)
		     handle ReduceType =>
		       unifyTy(ty1, reduceType ty2)
		       handle ReduceType => raise Unify("tycon mismatch"))

  The point marked is where the damage is done.  If both types have the same
  abbreviation constructor, unification will blithely go ahead and try to
  unify ALL of the arguments, even though some of them might be irrelevant
  because they are unused.

Fix:
  Three possibilities:
    1. Decide that this is a "feature", that you really don't want
       (int,int) bogus to unify with (int,int list) bogus.  However,
       I would argue that if this is what you want, you should be using
       the datatype facility, not the type facility.
    2. Forbid type abbreviations which do not use all their arguments.
       This is somewhat unsatisfying since, although human programmers
       will probably not produce abbreviations like this, it is easy
       to imagine automatic programming utilities (like Lex or Yacc) that
       MIGHT produce such code.
    3. Perform abbreviation expansion BEFORE unifying an abbreviated
       type with anything except a type variable (you would want to
       unify the type variable with the abbreviated type so that
       it can be printed correctly).  The best way to do this is
       probably to define a new constructor for the type "ty" called
       something like ABBREVty of tycon * tylist * ty where the
         tycon is the abbreviation constructor
         tylist are the constructor's arguments
         and ty is the "macro expanded" type

       Then, in unifyTy, you could have (right after the two VARty clauses)
	  | (ABBREVty(_,_,ty),_) => unifyTy(ty,ty2)
	  | (_,ABBREVty(_,_,ty)) => unifyTy(ty1,ty)
       to project through the abbreviation appropriately.

       The catch to this is that you can then produce circular types
       so you would have to perform an occur check during type printing.
       For instance, consider the following:
		type ('a,'b) bogus;
		fun f (x:'b,y:('a,'b) bogus) = ();
                fun g x = f (x,x);
       What is the type of g?  Really, it's 'a->unit but internally
       it's something like (pardon the abuse of notation):
		ABBREVty(bogus,['a,*],'a) --> unit
       where the * marks a circular reference back to the ABBREVty object.
       Obviously, a naive attempt to print this type will infinite loop--
       hence the requirement for an occur check during type printing.

395. weakness constraint problem
Submitter: John Reppy (jhr@cs.cornell.edu)
Date: Mar 18 1991
Problem:
I'm having trouble with a weakness constraint, and I don't understand it.
I have a function at top-level of a module, which the typechecker gives
the type

    val attach : 'aU CML.chan * widget_t * mbutton_t * 'aU menu_t -> widget_t

My memory is that the 'aU is an internal type variable?  Anyway, attach
calls another function taht also has an 'aU in its type; by adding a
type constraint to the other function, then things compile.  Anyway,
this seems like a bug (and I think I've run into it before).

401. Imperative types in SML/NJ 0.66

Severity: 
Problem: 
The following program compiles under Poly/ML 1.86, but fails to compile
under SML/NJ 0.66.


fun create (x:int) (y:'_a) :'_a Array.array = Array.array (x, y)

type ('a,'b) table = ('a*int*'b) list Array.array

val defaultSize = 97

fun createDefault (sample'value :'_a) :(string, '_a) table =
  let val mt = [] : (string * int * '_a) list

It will compile if Array.array is used directly in place of the curried
version.  It will also compile if createDefault is given an extra parameter,
either before or after the existing one.

This is the simplest example I've run across of SML/NJ failing to type
correct SML use of imperative types. It's fairly simple in this case -
it only took me a day to get the case this simple - but I've come across
at least one other example that I've just given up on.

I remember Dave MacQueen and mads Tofte discussing a bug in the SML/NJ
algorithm at the Edinburgh Workshop.  Is there any chance of a fix?

 As printing on the standard output and error streams usually are

 standard behaviour of these stream.

 It seems that NJ/ML delays output flushing until the computation of a
 top level expression has completed.  As mentioned above flushing
 should be performed immediately.  A temporary solution in NJ/ML is
 to redefine the `output' function, such that the predefined
 `flush_out' is automatically called:

      val output = fn(s,t) => (output(s,t); flush_out s)

 Future call of `output' will print the text immediately.

408. feedback from module system
Submitter:      tmb@ai.mit.edu
Date:           08/03/91
Version:        0.70
System:         Sun4/OS4.1.1
Severity:       cosmetic, but important

I have been playing around with building functors that abstract
various notions of "iteration", "array", "sequence", and "index"
(ultimately, this will hopefully provide a nicer alternative to the
equivalent data structures in the current SML library).

In general, using the ML module and type system for this seems
straightforward and natural, and I'm much more pleased with the way I
can design this code in SML than with similar code that I have written
in Scheme, CommonLisp, and C++.

However, I have also come across some cosmetic but (to me) important
problems with the NJ/SML module system.

Some of the problems are that the system isn't telling me enough about
the identity of objects to allow me to debug the code without having
to guess much; something analogous to the LispMachine inspector and
mouse sensitivity would ultimately be very useful, but for the time
being, just reporting unique tags for objects instead of "?"  would be
sufficient.

Some of this might also be a question of style, but my ignorance is
partially due to the fact that the only uses of the module system that
I have seen have been rather simple and straightforward (even if they
involve lots of code).

I'd appreciate your feedback.

						Thanks, Thomas.

PS: I can send you the complete code if you are interested, but
it is still more of a sketch or prototype.

= 1 ================================================================

I have a functor which generates iteration constructs for some data
type that it is handed (e.g., it generates "fold", "apply", etc. for
lists and arrays). It is very confusing that the types that the system
reports for the functions generated by this functor involve types of
the form "('a,'b) value" and "('a,'b) index". It would be much better
if the types were reported in their true form.

   signature S = sig type ('a,'b) data end;
   functor F(structure X:S) = struct fun f(x:('a,'b) X.data):('a,'b) X.data = x end;
   structure A = struct type ('a,'b) data = 'b list end;
   structure B = F(structure X=A);

   - B.f([1]);
   val it = [1] : ('a,int) A.data
   -

What I would want is:

   - B.f([1]);
   val it = [1] : int list
   -

Obviously, which form one wants depends on the exact use that a
functor is going to be put to. There should be a mechanism for me to
specify in the type binding which form of reporting I prefer.

= 2 ================================================================

Another problem that I have encountered is that it is nearly
impossible to figure out what goes wrong with complicated functor
applications with the current level of reporting: elements of
intermediate structures are now often only reported as
"?.KeyIndexing.foo", and it isn't helpful if the compiler tells you
that "?.KeyIndexing.foo" is a different type from "?.KeyIndexing.foo".

It would be much more convenient if there was an option to the
compiler that would trace and report functor applications, and if the
printer gave unique identities to structures, even temporary ones.

Something like:

   - use "foo";
   [Applying functor F<10> to structure <1001> giving structure <347> bound to structure T]
   [Applying functor G<11> to structure <66> giving structure <67> bound to structure T.M]
   [Applying functor G<11> to structure <33> giving structure <68> bound to structure T.M]
   - T.i;
   val it = SOMETHING : <11>.my_type;
   -

Printing unique ID's for structures (and, for that matter, for other
objects) shouldn't be hard, and it makes debugging so much easier.

= 3 ================================================================

When writing signatures for functors that generate polymorphic
functions, I seem to have to define types that carry around one type
variable for each polymorphic type, e.g.:

signature BASICACCESS =
    sig
	type ('a,'b) point
	type ('a,'b) value
	type ('a,'b) index
	type ('a,'b) range
	val first: ('a,'b) range -> ('a,'b) index
	val succ: ('a,'b) index -> ('a,'b) index
	val done: ('a,'b) index -> bool
	val mkindex: ('a,'b) point * ('a,'b) range -> ('a,'b) index
	val at: ('a,'b) index -> ('a,'b) value
    end;

Most of the polymorphic functions that get generated from BASICACCESS
structures will never need both type variables, while others may need
more than two.

For example,

structure BasicListIndex =
    struct
	type ('a,'b) point = 'a list
	type ('a,'b) value = 'a
	type ('a,'b) index = 'a list
	type ('a,'b) range = 'a list
	fun first x = x
	val succ = tl
	val done = null
	fun mkindex(x,y) = x
	fun at x = System.Unsafe.cast (hd x)  (* bug in NJSML .70 type checker ? *)
    end;

structure BasicArrayIndex =
    struct
	type ('a,'b) point = int
	type ('a,'b) index = int * int
	type ('a,'b) range = int
	fun first(limit:('a,'b) range):('a,'b) index = (0,limit)
	fun succ((x,limit):('a,'b) index):('a,'b) index = (x+1,limit)
	fun done((x,limit):('a,'b) index):bool = x>=limit
	fun at x = x
	fun mkindex(x,r) = (x,r)
	fun index1((x,_):('a,'b) index) = x
    end;

Carrying around the dummy type variables on types like "('a,'b) point"
is a bother. Perhaps a simple solution would be to allow the user to
omit type variables if they are specified as wildcards, e.g., "type
('_,'_) point = int" can be used simply as "val x : point" with the
compiler inserting the missing (wildcard) type variables by
convention.

More generally, it would seem to be nice if type constructors could
take variable numbers of arguments, and if they could pass their
argument lists around as complete entities (analogous to passing
around tuples of arguments in ML).

Another possibility would be to allow "free" type variables:

   type point = '_ list

This would simply be syntactic sugar for

   type 'a point = 'a list

and the compiler would implicitly provide a dummy argument to "point"
wherever it is used. However, this may break other parts of the type
or module system.

    Point 3 is really about a basic problem with the current
    way signatures and functors handle types, not about "'_". 

    Essentially, I want to write functors that generate objects
    that are polymorphic in different ways, e.g., that sometimes
    generate a function "f : 'a -> 'a" and sometimes "f : 'a -> 'b".

    The only way I could find of writing signatures for such functors is to
    make both the LHS and the RHS types (e.g.  type ('a,'b) arg; type
    ('a,'b) result) that depend on two type variables and instantiate them
    in the matching structures to the correct types. This causes a number
    of problems that I mentioned in my previous message.

    Another possibility would be to allow a function of type "'a -> 'a"
    to match a type specification "'a -> 'b", but that does not
    currently work.

    Functors that generate functions that are polymorphic
    in different ways are very important, and, one way or another,
    SML must make this more convenient than it is right now.

A related problem is that nongeneric weak type variables
generate an error even if they are never used:

   - val x: '0a t = 3;
   std_in:3.1-3.16 Error: nongeneric weak type variable
     x : '0aU t
   -

I think you can guess from the above structures and functors
how such non-generic weak type variables can pop up unexpectedly
(they are easy to fix for the user, by simply giving a type
to the value, but it seems odd for a user of, say structure
"Array2D" to have to specify some type as "(unit,int) array"
just to create an array of type "int array").

= 5 ================================================================

A minor problem with wildcard type variables:

- type ('_,'_) a;
std_in:7.7-7.11 Error: duplicate type variable: '1
std_in:7.7-7.11 Error: duplicate type variable: '1
std_in:7.7-7.11 Error: duplicate type variable: '1
std_in:7.7-7.11 Error: duplicate type variable: '1
std_in:7.7-7.11 Error: duplicate type variable: '1
- 

I think the "'_" should refer to a new type variable every time it is
used (this is, after all, what "_" does in ML).

    I believe it is possible to express type constraints like this
    with SML:

    signature S =
	sig
	    type ('a,'b) from
	    type ('a,'b) to
	    val f : ('a,'b) from -> ('a,'b) to
	end;

    structure X:S =
	struct
	    type ('a,'b) from = 'a
	    type ('a,'b) to = 'a
	    fun f(x) = x
	end;

    structure Y:S =
	struct
	    type ('a,'b) from = 'a * 'b
	    type ('a,'b) to = 'a
	    fun f(x,y) = x
	end;

    (These are actually not accepted by NJ/SML 0.70, even if the types for
    "f" are fully specified in the structure definitions (you get a
    different error message in that case), but I think that's a bug.)

    The main problem is that this use of types in signatures seems to have
    been rather uncommon so far, so, at least NJ/SML has several
    difficulties with it:

     * the type checker/module system (incorrectly?) rejects
       some constructs like this

     * unused type variables need to be instantiated by
       the user when they become weak; instead, the
       language could automatically define such variables to
       be "unit"

     * the type constructors "from" and "to" are really
       auxilliary, and users of S most likely never want
       to see them printed; the current system prints them

     * the writer of the signature "S" has to pick a maximum
       number of auxilliary type variables used as arguments
       to "from" and "to", but I believe that the actual maximum
       number needed depends on the arguments given to the functor,
       not on the functor itself

    I want to state again that I think this feature is important. Without
    the ability to specify signatures that can match structures that are
    polymorphic in different ways, it seems I would have to write
    completely redundant versions of some functors.

    The context in which it came up was writing a functor that generates
    iteration constructs for collections; for some collections, indexes
    and values are different types, for others, they are the same type.

409. type checking after functor application
Submitter:      tmb@ai.mit.edu
Date:           08/05/91
Version:        0.70
System:         Sun4/OS4.1.1
Severity:       ?
Problem:

Basically, I have something like:

functor F(...) =
    struct
        structure A = G(...);
        ...
        open A
    end;

structure X = F(...);

X.A.f arg;               --> works
X.f arg;                 --> fails with a type error

Comment:

X.A.f and X.f must refer to the same value with the same type: A has
simply been opened at the end of structure X. I don't see how X.f
could ever behave differently from X.A.f.

Sorry about the long code needed to reproduce the bug. I had several
guesses what the problem might be due to, but I have not been able
to reduce the code further than this. In particular, the problem
goes away if the last functor application is removed, i.e.,

   functor GeneralArray(structure Index:BASICACCESS) = struct ... end;
   structure Arrays = GeneralArray(structure Index = BasicArrayIndex);

is replaced with

   structure Arrays =
       struct
           structure Index:BASICACCESS = BasicArrayIndex
           ... body of functor GeneralArray ...
       end

Also, don't try to make sense of the code. To isolate the bug this
far, I collapsed several types.

Code: (file foo.sml)
  signature BASICACCESS =
      sig
	  type ('a,'b) index
	  type ('a,'b) range
	  val first: ('a,'b) range -> ('a,'b) index
	  val succ: ('a,'b) index -> ('a,'b) index
	  val done: ('a,'b) index -> bool
      end;

  functor GeneralIteration(structure Access:BASICACCESS) =
      struct
	  local
	      open Access
	  in
	      fun apply f r =
		  let
		      fun loop(i) = if done(i) then () else (f(i); loop(succ(i)))
		  in
		      loop(first(r))
		  end
	  end
      end;

  functor GeneralArray(structure Index:BASICACCESS) =
      struct
	  type ('a,'b) array = 'b Array.array * ('a,'b) Index.range

	  structure ValueIndex =
	      struct
		  type ('a,'b) range = ('a,'b) array
		  type ('a,'b) index = 'b Array.array * ('a,'b)Index.index
		  fun first((a,r):('a,'b) range) = (a,Index.first(r))
		  fun succ((a,r):('a,'b) index) = (a,Index.succ(r))
		  fun done((a,r):('a,'b) index) = Index.done(r)
	      end

	  structure Value = GeneralIteration(structure Access = ValueIndex)

	  fun array(r:(unit,'1b) Index.range,initial):(unit,'1b) array =
	      (Array.array(100,initial),r)

	  open Value
      end;

  structure BasicArrayIndex =
      struct
	  type ('a,'b) index = int * int
	  type ('a,'b) range = int
	  fun first(limit:('a,'b) range):('a,'b) index = (0,limit)
	  fun succ((x,limit):('a,'b) index):('a,'b) index = (x+1,limit)
	  fun done((x,limit):('a,'b) index):bool = x>=limit
      end;

  structure Arrays = GeneralArray(structure Index = BasicArrayIndex);

410. inlining property not preserved in simple renaming
Submitter: Andrew Tolmach (apt@cs.princeton.edu)
Date: 8/6/91
Version: 0.73
Severity: minor
Problem: 
  If I use System.Unsafe.getvar directly, it is inlined, as expected.

  If I type

  val g = System.Unsafe.getvar

  then g does not have access INLINE.

  Dbm suggests that this is because g is being eta-expanded; I haven't found
  where this happens in the source.

  In any case, I don't know why the initial definition of


  val getvar = InLine.getvar

  inside the definition of System.Unsafe *does* manage to transfer the inline
  property...  Is it because there's something special about structure InLine?

Fix: look for MARKexps around the rhs VALvar.
  Tolmach: abstract syntax marking.  The MARKexps surrounding the RHS of

    val a = System.Unsafe.getvar

  prevent the INLINE-ness of getvar being recognized by parse/corelang.sml valbind.
  If I turn off marking, it works.
  Tarditi: We should alter parse/corelang.sml valbind so that it recognizes this
  case specially and properly assigns the INLINE property.

Comments: (Tarditi)
  There's an incorrect assumption in checkopen, which tests whether
  any value in a structure which has been rebound is still accessible.
  Let the old structure be called S and the new environment be N.  Let
  the symbols bound in the environment of S be T.   The assumption is
  that if any symbol A in T is unbound in N, then all other symbols
  in T are also unbound in N.  This is clearly untrue, as the above
  example shows, where x is unbound in the environment after the redefinition
  of A but y is not.

413. System and IO problems
Submitter: Emden Gansner
Date: 8/16/91
Version: 0.71
Problem: 
  The version of system in the System structure should have type string -> int

  The execute function in IO is incorrect as written. It passes the
  the value of environ() to exec, but this is a list of SML strings
  and exec expects a list of C strings. It should pass (map c_string environ())
  instead.

  Finally, the execute function would be a lot more useful if it allowed
  a list of arguments as well as program pathname.

416. equality property checking in functor parameter matching
Submitter: Simon Finn <simon@abstract-hardware-ltd.co.uk>
Date: 9/13/91
Version: ?
Severity: minor
Problem: 
Try the following simple (?) exercise in semantics, provided by my
colleague Mike Crawley:
 
	signature PSIG =
	sig
	  eqtype 'a symTab ;
          datatype guide = G1 | G2 of guide symTab
        end;

(Q1) Is guide an eqtype? (in PSIG)
(A1) Yes, since we require the equality-principal signature.

	functor PFUN (structure S : sig type 'a symTab end) =
	struct
	  open S;
	  datatype guide = G1 | G2 of guide symTab;
	end;

(Q2) Is guide an eqtype? (in the output signature of PFUN)
(A2) No, because symTab isn't and our signatures must respect equality


	structure S = struct datatype 'a symTab = Empty end;
	structure P = PFUN(structure S = S);

(Q3) Is guide an eqtype? (in the signature of P)
(A3) No, because it wasn't in the functor.
     Technically, this is because the realisation, \phi, used
     to instantiate the body of the functor doesn't touch
     the bound type names contained in the output signature
     of the functor (except, possibly, for an alpha-conversion).
     
	P.G1 = P.G1;

(Q4) Is this legal?
(A4) No, because P.guide is not an eqtype (see above).

	functor MFUN(structure X : PSIG) =
	struct
	  val z = X.G1 = X.G1;
	end;
	structure M = MFUN(structure X = P);

(Q5) Is this legal?
(A5) No, because MFUN demands that guide be an eqtype (see Q1),
     but P.guide is not an eqtype (see Q3, Q4).


Both SMLNJ 0.66 and Poly/ML 1.88 get Q1 - Q4 right but get Q5 wrong.
Poly/ML 1.98 gets Q1 - Q5 right.

Comment: Conjecture that this is a benign bug.  Have not been able to
  come up with version that is actually wrong.

Fix: Could record equality properties inferred in parameter signature
     instantiation in the signature (memoizing).

Comments: The enclosed code is a trimmed version of a big program, got in an

	  does nothing and is full of redundancy. But whatever I did to try to

	  Here are some of the things I have tried :
	  * not use the signature constraint on the structure
	  * delete any of the redundant function definitions, e.g."components"
	  * remove the redundant call to function "position" in "new_node"
	  * or, even call "position" with argument NULL
	  * remove a clause from any function definition(I tried many of them)
	  * flat the record, e.g. make type frame = tree
	  * remove the boolean field in type "baseframe"
	  * get rid of second argument of functions "tn_set_position" and
	    "tn_set_bounding_box"
	  * replace equal by equal, e.g. replace calls to "tn_set_position"
	    by ()
	  * replace recursive call by direct call, e.g. in "Canvas" clause of
	    function "set_position"
	Conclusion: These are so diverse that I can not even guess any.

Comment: (Lal George)
  There is an operating system level 3 call that can be used to
  get the working directory.
  Unfortunately, we cannot use this because it does a malloc.
  So we have to build up the working directory pathname by
  interpreting inodes.
  It is my guess that this is what bombs out in the Andrew file
  system.
  ** This is probably another example of bug #651 (JHR, 10/6/92) **

423. printing of structure signatures

  Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.73, 10 September 1991

      val vector_n : int * 'a list -> 'a vector
    end

Comments: [Dave Tarditi]
The reported behavior is intentional: the basic idea is that if we know
the name of a structure's signature, we print the name of the signature
instead of the whole signature.

More formally, if S is structure which is bound to structure id SX,
and S was the result of doing a signature match against signature T,
which itself is bound to signature identifier TX, then when we print
the signature for the structure bound to SX, we will print TX, provided
that TX is still bound to the same signature.

Thus we get the following results at the top-level:

- structure S = IO;
structure S : IO
- structure T = S;
structure T : IO

but when we re-bind the signature identifier IO we get:

- signature IO = sig end;
signature IO =
  sig
  end
- structure S = IO
structure S =
  sig 
    type instream
  ...
  end

The problem is that the signature identifier VECTOR is not in 
the top-level environment.  To fix this, change
build/process.sml, lines 202-204 from:

           map Symbol.sigSymbol ["REF","LIST","ARRAY","BYTEARRAY","IO","BOOL",
 				 "ENVIRON", "COMPILE", 
		                 "STRING","INTEGER","REAL","GENERAL"]
to:
           map Symbol.sigSymbol ["REF","LIST","ARRAY","BYTEARRAY","IO","BOOL",
 				 "ENVIRON", "COMPILE"
		                 "STRING","INTEGER","REAL","GENERAL",
	                         "VECTOR"]

Maybe we should add a flag to toggle this behavior, but I was hoping
that we would an environment browsing structure to the compiler
instead.  It's a kludge to have to type "structure S = S" to see the
signature of S.

425. profiler flakiness
Submitter: Frank Pfenning
Date: 10/2/91
Version: 0.73
Problem: 
    I am currently in the process of eliminating obvious inefficiencies in an ML
  implementation of a logic programming language.  While using the profiler, I
  noticed that it seemed to lead to inordinately large core images during the
  development (there is also a small overhead for the mere fact that we are
  profiling, but that is acceptable).  My guess is the profiler keeps a
  (non-weak) pointer to code somehow, which prevents it from being garbage
  collected even if it is no longer accessible from the top-level.  The fact
  that redefined functions show up twice or more often in the profiling
  statistics seem to confirm that, but I may be using it wrong, or there could
  be other reasons.  I would be interested to hear what the
  developer/implementor of the profiler has to say about this.  Thanks,
Comment: (Andrew Appel)
  Yes, I think your analysis is correct.
  There's a profiler function that resets the profiler; perhaps that's
  what you want.  But if you use it, you'd have to reload your entire
  source code.

  (* TOKEN: signature revealing the internal structure of a token. This signature
     TOKEN distinct from the signature {parser name}_TOKENS produced by ML-Yacc.
     The {parser name}_TOKENS structures contain some types and functions to
      construct tokens from values and positions.

     The representation of token was very carefully chosen here to allow the
     polymorphic parser to work without knowing the types of semantic values
     or line numbers.

     This has had an impact on the TOKENS structure produced by SML-Yacc, which
     is a structure parameter to lexer functors.  We would like to have some
     type 'a token which functions to construct tokens would create.  A
     constructor function for a integer token might be

	    INT: int * 'a * 'a -> 'a token.

     This is not possible because we need to have tokens with the representation
     given below for the polymorphic parser.

     Thus our constructur functions for tokens have the form:

	    INT: int * 'a * 'a -> (svalue,'a) token

     This in turn has had an impact on the signature that lexers for SML-Yacc
     must match and the types that a user must declare in the user declarations
     section of lexers.

430. Subscript in lookTycPath
Submitter: Dave MacQueen
Date: 8/3/91
Version: 0.70
Severity: serious
Problem: 
  Following code causes
    $$ lookTycPath 2: [2,0]
    tyconInContext: [2,0]
  messages in d70, indicating Subscript has been raised while
  interpreting a relative type address.
Code: 
  signature S2 =
  sig
    structure A : sig type t end
    datatype u = ITEM of A.t
  end;

  functor F(X : sig type v end ) =
  struct
    type w = X.v
  end;

  functor G(Y : S2) =
  struct
    structure B = F(struct type v = Y.u end)
  end;

Comments:
Problem is bad env passed to redefineCon (typing/functor.sml) during the
application of functor F within the body of G.  The env for the instantiated
body of F is being used to interpret the type of datacon ITEM from the
parameter Y: S2.  lookTycPath aborts with a Subscript exception, which
gets caught by ArrayExt.app in redoTycs.

431. ml_writev
Submitter: Dave Tarditi
Date: 7/1/91
Version: 0.69
Severity: minor
Problem: 
    The function ml_writev in cfuns.c for version 0.69 appears to have
    a bug; the reference to callc_v in it should have 1 added to it, since
    callc_v is a label that points to the tag of a closure, not
    the closure itself.  By the way, callc_v is defined in the
    header file prim.h.
Fix:
    The diff of the old version with the new version is below.

    570d569
    < 		extern int callc_v[];
    577,578c576,577
    < 		MLState->ml_closure = PTR_CtoML(callc_v);
    < 		MLState->ml_pc	    = CODE_ADDR(PTR_CtoML(callc_v));
    ---
    > 		MLState->ml_closure = PTR_CtoML(callc_v+1);
    > 		MLState->ml_pc	    = CODE_ADDR(PTR_CtoML(callc_v+1));
Status: Fixed in 0.74 (or earlier).

432. corrupted (shell) environment
Submitter: Julian Bradfield <jcb@lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk>
Date: 7/1/91
Version: 0.66
System: Sparc
Problem: 
    NJ SML version 0.66 (running on Sparc) sometimes corrupts its
    environment: after compiling a piece of code, executed sub-processes get
    an environment with (apparently) random characters added to
    environment values. (The specific piece of code is too long to include
    here; I don't know how general the problem is.)
Comment: [dbm] sent mail asking for code to reproduce the problem.
    This is the same as #342.  [Bradfield confirms that problem is fixed in
    0.75 in mail sent 12/5/91.]

433. lexgen bug
Submitter: Julian Bradfield <jcb@lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk>
Date: 7/1/91
Version: 0.66
Problem: 
  In the lexgen.sml distributed with 0.66, there is a bug at line
  1047; when outputting the arguments for the "action" function, there
  should be a test for !UsesTrailingContext . If true, should the third
  argument just be nil ?
Status: fixed in 0.74

434. interactive input
Submitter: Lawrence Paulson <Larry.Paulson@computer-lab.cambridge.ac.uk>
Date: 1/1/91
Version: 0.66 (and later)
Problem: 
  I think there's something strange with interactive I/O.  Consider the
  following:

  fun prs s = output(std_out,s);
  val pause_tac = Tactic (fn state => 
    (prs"** Press RETURN to continue: ";
     if input(std_in,1) = "\n" then Sequence.single state
     else (prs"Goodbye\n";  Sequence.null)));

  New Jersey ML waits for input and prints the prompt afterwards.  The behavior
  of ML's I/O is not precisely defined, but most languages flush any awaiting
  output before demanding input.

  Really, I would like to accept single-character inputs (rather than lines
  ending with CR) but Standard ML seems to have no suitable primitive!
Status: not really a bug, but a sensible request

435. patrow syntax
Submitter:      Matti Jokinen, moj@utu.fi
Date:		28-Jul-1991
Version:        0.69
System:         Sun 3
Severity:       minor

Problem:        The compiler fails to accept the following patrow syntax:

			id:ty as pat

Code:           fun f {x:int as y} = x;

Transcript:     - fun f {x:int as y} = x;
		Error: Compiler bug: patType -- unexpected pattern

Comments:	The following patterns are translated correctly:

			{x = x:int as y}
			{x as y}
			{x:int}

		I think the bug is caused by a missing branch is in the
		patType function (lines 128-194 in src/typing/typecheck.sml).
		The parser appears to transform `id:ty as pat' into
		LAYEREDpat(CONSTAINTpat(_,ty),pat), which is not recognized
		by patType.

Date:           Jul 1, 1991
Version:        0.66
System:         Sparc IPC, SunOS 4.1.1
Problem:        the debugger reports tycon mismatch on a correct program
Code:
  (* dec (x,l) is the string decimal representation of x over l characters,
     right justified. If l characters are not enough, then l "*" are returned.
     If l <= 0, then an exception is raised. *)
  
  exception wrong_field_size
  fun dec (x, l) =
    if l <= 0
      then raise wrong_field_size
      else 
        let fun dok (0, "") = "0"
              | dok (0, s) = s
              | dok (x, s) = dok (x div 10, chr(x mod 10 + ord("0")) ^ s)
            fun fill (s, l) =
              if size s > l
                then
                  let fun dc 0 = ""
                        | dc l = "*" ^ dc (l-1)
                  in
                    dc l
                  end
                else
                  let fun dc 0 = ""
                        | dc l = " " ^ dc (l-1)
                  in
                    dc (l - size s) ^ s
                  end

		The debugger works for a trivial factorial program.


From apt@Princeton.EDU Tue Jul  2 10:28:41 1991
This is indeed a (minor) bug, which I'll handle in due course.
The problem seems to be that the run function is hiding the user's 
(re-)definition of dec with the pervasive Integer.dec.
There is a trivial work-around: call the user function something different.

Status: fixed as of 0.88

437. mlyacc syntax problem
Submitter: Andrew Wright <wright@rice.edu>
Date: 7/3/91
Version: 0.69
Problem: 
The source file "yacc.sml" of mlyacc from the 0.69 release does not compile
under the 0.69 release because of a syntax error at line 350:

		     EAPP(EVAR(valueStruct^"."^
			     if hasType (NONTERM lhs)
				  then saySym(NONTERM lhs)
                                  else ntvoid),
Fix:
The "if then else" needs to be parenthesized.

Status: fixed in 0.73

438. callcc typing unsound
Submitter: Robert Harper <rwh@proof.ergo.cs.cmu.edu>
Date: 7/3/91
Version: 0.70
Severity: critical
Problem: 
  Recently Mark Lillibridge and I have been trying to investigate a
  number of questions of type soundness in the presence of polymorphism
  and control operators.  As you may recall, I have been unable to find
  a cps transform that (1) is faithful to the ML operational semantics,
  and (2) admits a suitable typing result to guarantee soundness in
  Milner's sense.  We discovered that the central issue is to do with
  the scope of type variables.  This got us to thinking, and late last
  night Mark came up with the following example which demonstrates that
  ML with callcc and polymorphism is UNSOUND.  Run it in SML/NJ to see
  what I mean.  We plan to investigate the matter further, and will keep
  you posted.
Code: 
  fun left (x,y) = x;
  fun right (x,y) = y;

  let val later = (callcc (fn k =>
	  (  fn x => x,  fn f => throw k (f, fn f => ())  ) ))
  in
	  print (left(later)"hello");
	  right(later)(fn x => x+2)
  end
Fix:
  Making the type of callcc weakly polymorphic appears to fix the problem.
Status: fixed in 0.73 (by making callcc weakly polymorphic)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
439. lexgen
Submitter: Julian Bradfield <jcb@lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk>
Date: 7/8/91
Version: 0.66
Problem: 
  lexgen.sml distributed with NJ SML 0.66, lines 983 to 986.
  The variable i in the pattern clashes with i in a pattern much higher
  up. I *think* that all occurrences of i in these four lines should be 
  k, say, while the i on line 987 is indeed i.
  (The symptom of this bug is uncaught Substring exceptions, when a
  state identifier gets passed as a length to accept.)

  Has anybody got the look-ahead facility of ML-Lex to work?
Comment: Tarditi noticed that the ASU lookahead algorithm is buggy, so
	 this feature has been removed.
Status: fixed in 0.74

440. missing Perv.mos
Submitter:  Matti Jokinen, moj@utu.fi
Date:	    15-Jun-1991

441. parsing large positive integers
Submitter:      Olaf Burkart <burkart@zeus.informatik.rwth-aachen.de>
Date:           7/16/90
Version:        0.69
System:         SPARC, SunOS 4.1
Problem:
I have found the following bug in sml 0.69:

Can't parse large positive integers.
Can't load the Edinburgh SML Library.

Problem (1):        2^30 - 1 (maxint) could not be read

- ~1073741824;
val it = ~1073741824 : int
- 1073741823;

uncaught exception Overflow

Comment: [dbm] Is this the same as bug 327, which is claimed to be fixed in 0.69?
Status: Fixed in 0.72. This is related to bug 327 and 444 [lg].

442. Runbind exception
Submitter:      Olaf Burkart <burkart@zeus.informatik.rwth-aachen.de>
Date:           7/16/90
Version:        0.69
System:         SPARC, SunOS 4.1
Problem:
It seems to me that the Runbind error from BUG 262. is back again.
I tried to load the Edinburgh SML Library, but after fixing problem (1)
the sml interpreter aborts with "uncaught exception Runbind" in the structure
definition:

structure Int: INT =
struct
	...
  exception Overflow = Overflow
  and Div = Div
	...
end
Status: probably fixed; can't check without source (related bug 419 is fixed)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
443. equality attributes in datatype specs
Submitter: Colin Meldrum <colin@harlqn.co.uk>
Date: Wed, 17 Jul 91
Version: 0.66
Problem: 
In New Jersey v66, the following signature does not elaborate:

signature S =
  sig
    type 'a s

    datatype t = A of int -> int

    datatype
      v = D of w s
    and
      w = E of t
  end

It gives the error:

std_in:16.5-24.2 Error: inconsistent equality properties

However, by swapping the two datdesc clauses in the final datatype spec the
signature can be made to elaborate correctly:

signature S =
  sig
    type 'a s

    datatype t = A of int -> int

    datatype
      w = E of t
    and
      v = D of w s
  end

Status: fixed in 0.73

444. large constants and Overflow
This is an supplement to the bug:
	327 large constants cause overflow in compilation
	from Apr 23.
Submitter: 
	Juergen Buntrock,
	TU-Berlin,
	jubu@cs.tu-berlin.de
Date: Tue Apr 23 13:50:05 MET DST 1991
Version: 0.70
System: Sun4-60 / SunOS Release 4.1.1
Problem: 
	The function primops in (cps/cpsopt.sml line 658) transforms
	integer compare operation somtimes in arithmetic
	operations which may raise Overflow.

	An example is function sizeImmed (in sparc/sparc.sml).
	This functions raise an Overflow  for constant values
	bigger than (maxinit-4096)

Comments:	The code is incorrect, but it shouldn't cause the
compiler to claim it has a bug in itself! The cause seems somewhat
related to the fact that MirTypes has no substructure LambdaTypes,
simply misspelling sharing on a line which is an otherwise valid
sharing constraint line does not exhibit the problem.

Status: possibly fixed in 0.73?  (incomplete source, can't test)

447. identity type abbreviation
Submitter:      tmb@ai.mit.edu
Date:           08/02/91
Version:        0.70
System:         Sun4/OS4.1.1
Severity:       ?
Problem:        the type checker refuses to accept the following definition
Code:

structure S =
    struct
	type 'b data = 'b list
	type 'b value = 'b
	fun at(x:'b data):'b value = hd x
    end;

Transcript:

   hack.sml:5.2-5.34 Error: expression and constraint don't agree (bound type var)
     expression: 'bU
     constraint: 'bU value
     in expression:
       Initial.hd x

Comments:

   I'm not sure whether this is a bug, but certain types of functors
   seem to be difficult to express if you cannot write definitions like
   this.

   In particular, it seems like I have to write two separate functors
   depending on whether "'b value" is simply "'b" or whether it
   is some other type dependent on "'b" (e.g., "'b list"). This
   seems very unnatural.

signature S =
    sig
	type 'a data
	type 'a value
	val at: 'b data -> 'b value
    end;

functor F(structure X:S) =
    struct
	open X
	fun pair_at x = (at x,at x)
    end;

structure A =
    struct
	type 'a data = 'a list
	type 'a value = 'a list
	val at = (fn x => x)
    end;

structure FA = F(structure X = A);
    
structure B =
    struct
	type 'a data = 'a list
	type 'a value = 'a
	val at = hd
    end;

(* why can't I do this??? *)

structure FB = F(structure X = B);
Fix: type abbreviations must be expanded when unifying with UBOUND type variables
     in Unify (basics/unify.sml).  The definition of equalTypes in TypesUtil
     must be changed in a similar manner.

Comments:
    While I do ultimately expect some kind of drastic termination,
    I do **NOT** expect to be unceremoniously dumped out of ML back
    into the Shell.  A more reasonable strategy might be to preallocate
    a chunk of memory to be used as secondary storage while recovering
    from exhaustion of primary storage.  That, at least, would allow
    for a return to top level and associated garbage collection, which,
    in many cases, would allow interactive execution to resume.

    Incidentally, this example was run on a Sparcstation with 64
    megabytes of physical memory and no limit on process size
    that I know of.  I don't know why it gave up the ghost at
    28 megabytes -- do you?

463. unmatched datatype in signature matching
Submitter : Sylvie Thiebaux  sylvie@gmd.de
Date 10 - 07 - 91
Version SML 0.66
Severity major (critical ?)
Problem :  unmatched datatype
Code :
I cannot narrow down the cause of the problem more than I have already done.
I have got several files in which I let only the necessary things. All the
files excpeted the main file can be compliled. When I compile the main file
I get the error ``unmatched datatype literal'' at the point indicated in the
program. It is maybe a problem of a sharing constraint on this type that I have given in the file LOGIC.sml. But I have already used the LOGIC signature
in a larger programm and this sharing constraint seemed to cause no problem.

Here are all the modules involved in the error message. Please do not be
surprised about what each module contains. I need each of them but I wanted to
let in each of them only the minimal necessary code in order to make your task
easier.

464. defining exception as data constructor
Submitter: David Tarditi
Date: 7/19/91
Version: 0.70
Severity: minor
Problem: 
  The following results in a compiler bug message in version 0.70:

  datatype d = D;
  exception e = D;

  The error message is:
  Error: Compiler bug: in makedec EXCEPTIONdec

Comment:

This is probably due to the fact that exceptions and constructors
share the same name space.  A check that the binding for the rhs of
"exception e = ..." is an exception is probably missing.

470. top-level continuations

Problem:	the typing of toplevel continuation is incorrect
Code:		see later
Transcript:	see later
Comments:	this bug cannot be corrected because toplevel continuations

Being what could be called a 'naive user', I first thought my

easy enough to find when one knows what to search for.

  when I use the special character $.  Here is the source:
Code: 

    datatype lexresult = EOF;
    fun eof () = EOF;
    %%
    %%
    ";".*$	=> (lex());

Comments: the rule is meant to parse a lisp-style comment.
  Andrew sez:  I'm not sure that this is really a bug.  Perhaps the
  documentation needs to be changed?

477. duplicate specifications through include
Submitter: Nick Rothwell
Date: 21 Oct 91
Version: 0.73
Severity: minor
Problem: 
    I enclose a short-ish (40 line) program. It compiles under poplog and one
    version of poly. It fails under another version of poly and with different
    errors under two versions of SML/NJ. By my reckoning, the program is legal
    SML.
Code: 
  signature MONO_SET =
    sig
      type Element
      type Set
      type T sharing type T = Set
    end;

  functor MonoSet(type T): MONO_SET =
    struct
      abstype Set = Set of T list
      with
	type Element = T
	type T = Set
      end
    end;

  signature INPUT_VAR =
    sig
      type InputVar
      type InputVarSet

      include MONO_SET sharing type Element = InputVar
			   and type Set = InputVarSet

      type T sharing type T = InputVar
    end;

480. Exit status of makeml is 1.
Submitter: David Tarditi
Date: 10/23/91
Version: 0.75?
Severity: minor
Problem: 
    makeml almost always returns an exit status of 1, which
    indicates failure.   This is because as a shell program it
    returns the value of its last command, which is an if-statement
    that almost always "fails" (the value of the if-statement is
    the last simple command that it executes, which is a test that
    fails; there is no "else" clause to execute).

    This creates problems for me when I use a makefile that invokes
    makeml to build sml images.  Could you make the last statement
    in makeml "exit 0" ?

483. lexgen compilation blowup
Submitter:	Lie Ma, ma@cs.pdx.edu
Date:		10/29/1991
Version:	SML Ver.0.66
System:		Sun Sparc
Code:		lexgen.sml Ver. 1.3, Dec'89
Encl:		typescript
Problem:	
	
	I'm using lexgen to write a lexer for a formal specification language.
	According to the manual, I should use lexgen.sml in the following way:

	quote: 
		Running ML-Lex
		Use "lexgen.sml"; this will create a structre LexGen. 
		The function LexGen.lexGen creates a program for a
		lexer from an input specification. It takes a string
		argument -- the name of the file containing the input
		spacification. The output file name is determined by
		appending ".sml" to the input file name.
	end{quote}

	I got the extremly poor performance when I tried to use "lexgen.sml".
	I tried on two Suns, both taking appr. 25 to 28 minutes to evaluate
	"lexgen.sml". The maximum heap was about 16 MB. The process was so 
	huge that the system speeded donw and I had to kill it in most cases.
	And once other user even could not run latex within emacs.

	I want to know whether it is usual. If not, it's caused by ML or 
	"lexgen.sml"?

	Thank you to your attention to this. Your prompt reply will be 
	appreciated.

484. interrupt is buggy (same as 511, 518)
Submitter: Mike Crawley
Date: 10/29/91
Version: 0.73
System: Sparc/SunOS
Severity: major
Problem: 
  I have been able to repeat the following
  bug a number of times. Pressing ^C to interrupt
  sml while it is busy can sometimes crash it.
  The saved image I was using was 10MB at the time.
  
  ^C
  SIGEMT not related to gc (bogus test: 0x9de3bfc0 @ 0x9dd8)
  
Transcript: 
Comments:
    This is a very mysterious bug that has been around for a while.  The
    "0x9de3bfc0 @ 0x9dd8" means that the signal handler received a SIGEMT
    signal with the PC = 0x9dd8 and the instruction at that address being
    "save %sp,-0x40,%sp."  Under my reading of the documentation, this
    should never occur in SunOS.  The address 0x9dd8 is interesting, since
    it is the address of an assembly routine used to force a GC trap
    after a signal (such as ^C), but I don't understand how the sigcontext
    program counter gets that value.  [John Reppy]

whittle it down to the above rather useless function.

Comments:

While I do ultimately expect some kind of drastic termination,
I do **NOT** expect to be unceremoniously dumped out of ML back
into the Shell.  A more reasonable strategy might be to preallocate
a chunk of memory to be used as secondary storage while recovering
from exhaustion of primary storage.  That, at least, would allow
for a return to top level and associated garbage collection, which,
in many cases, would allow interactive execution to resume.

Incidentally, this example was run on a Sparcstation with 64
megabytes of physical memory and no limit on process size
that I know of.  I don't know why it gave up the ghost at
28 megabytes -- do you?

Comments:
  I have been running into this problem for a while now in 
  some program analysis implementation work, but was not sure where
  the problem was.  After about 3-4 rebuilds of my system I usually
  have to start another core image.  

  The general problem occurs on sparc, sun4 and pmax machines;
  the specific code given above has been tried on a sparc (24MB) and a
  pmax (64MB?).  If the "open Mem_hog" is removed, then the problem goes
  away.  The problem is not specific to arrays; for example if X is
  bound to a list of a couple of thousand elements instead of an array,
  then similar behaviour occurs.

I have been looking in the compiler source and I discovered
a small bug:
Code:
(* cpsopt.sml
 *
 * Copyright 1989 by AT&T Bell Laboratories
 *)
functor CPSopt(val maxfree : int) :
        sig val reduce : CPS.function * System.Unsafe.object option * bool
                                        -> CPS.function
        end =
struct

structure Fastlib = struct

structure Ref = 
  struct
    open Ref
    fun inc r = r := !r + 1
    fun dec r = r := !r + 1		(* this is the worrying bit!*)
  end

Comment:
  dec is used but only in the function `unescapeargs'.  I
  guess that it should be fixed before it causes any grief.
Status: Fixed in 0.75

    - can_input instr;
    val it = 0 :int
Fix: (luochen@shade.Princeton.EDU (Luoqi Chen))
    I believe the problem is in the runtime routine, ml_exec(), it calls
    execve(2) instead of execvp(3), so it won't look up in the PATH for the
    command. Try "/bin/ls" instead.

    The fix is simple, change the line (line 1238 of src/runtime/cfuns.c)
	    execve (cmd, argv, envp);
    to
	    { extern char **environ = envp;
	    execvp(cmd, argv);}

500. memory leak
Submitter: Kjeld H. Mortensen, metasoft!kjeld@uunet.UU.NET, (617) 576.6920 x 22
Date: 1/7/92
Version: 0.75
System:
  SUN OS 4.1.1, ram 32Mb, swap 103Mb, and
  HPUX 8.0, ram 32Mb, swap 70Mb.
Severity: major
Problem: 
    During use of the extended compiler we see a significant slowdown of 
    this process when using v0.75 of SML/NJ (a factor 2 over a time period
    of 15 minutes reasonable heavy use, and doesn't seem to stop there).
Observations:
	1) We see absolutely no slow down when using v0.62 of SML/NJ on the
	   Sun4 (haven't been able to succesfully compile this version on
	   the HP9000 though).
	2) We see significant slow down when using v0.75 of SML/NJ on both
	   the Sun4 and HP9000. (In spite of the slow down, the compiler 
	   process gets more and more CPU-time.)
	3) Since we use the same ML-code in both cases 1) and 2), I'm lead to 
           conclude that it must be a problem in the SML/NJ system v0.75.

Example:
	Unfortunately I haven't been able to reproduce the phenomenon for a 
	reasonable small example.

Followup:
>...By the way, is your slow-down program mostly compiling things, or executing
>compiled code?

It is mostly executing compiled code.


I made some further investigations regarding the heap size. Each of the 
experiments performed, make up the same amount of work for the ML process
(work is measured in units of what I call "steps").

In the following table, "MEM-INC" is calculated using numbers from the first
and the last major collection. Let the output from the two major collections 
have the format:

	[Major collection... <P1>% used (<MUSED1>/<MTOT1>), <T1> msec]
	[Major collection... <Pn>% used (<MUSEDn>/<MTOTn>), <Tn> msec]

The numbers in "MEM-INC" then have the format: 

	<MUSEDn>-<MUSED1>/<MTOTn>-<MTOT1>,

"/" not to be confused with division.

The numbers in "Work" are only there to show that the compiler in each
experiment, did the same amount of computations.

Machine configurations:
   Sun4      , SUN OS 4.1.1, ram 32Mb, swap 103Mb, and
   HP9000s400, HPUX 8.0    , ram 32Mb, swap  70Mb.


Machine    | SML/NJ | Work/steps | MEM-INC/bytes | Number of major coll.

Sun4       | v0.62  |     203    |  18292/179960 |          4

501. out of date yacc example code
Submitter: Andy Koenig
Date: 1/11/92
Version: ?
Severity: minor
Problem: 
  The calc.grm.sig, calc.grm.sml, and calc.lex.sml file in mlyacc/examples/calc
  needs to be updated.  Rerun ml-yacc and ml-lex on the appropriate files.
Fix:
In the calc directory are the following files:

README
calc.grm
calc.grm.desc
calc.grm.sig
calc.grm.sml
calc.lex
calc.lex.sml
join.sml
load.sml

Saying

	sml-lex calc.lex

rebuilds calc.lex.sml; saying

	sml-yacc calc.grm

rebuilds calc.grm.*

That should be done in the distribution directories so that people
will get the right versions.
[from Dave Tarditi:]
  The directory tools/mlyacc/examples contains some files
  which need to be regenerated by the new versions of
  the parser and lexer generator.

  You need to regenerate the files examples/calc/calc.grm.sml,
  examples/calc.lex.sml by running the parser generator
  on calc.grm and the lexer generator on calc.lex.

  Please remove the file examples/fol/fol.lex.sml.

502. zombie sml processes
Submitter: Stephen Adams <S.R.Adams@ecs.southampton.ac.uk>
Date: 1/13/92
Version:        0.66, 0.75
System:         SunOS 4.1, sparc
Severity:       minor
Problem:        SML processes don't die if you log out
Code:           any running sml process
Comment:
    We use NJ-SML for teaching and research.  A common problem
    is if a user logs out (by selecting `exit' in X-windows, for
    example) the sml proces doesnt die, but sits there consuming
    cpu cycles (often > 40% of the cpu time).  With a large
    number of naive users this is a serious problem.  Even
    `sophisticated' users sometimes accidentally slug a machine
    for a few days.  It would be much friendlier to the
    community if an SML process running (foreground under a
    shell) under Xterm or under emacs would die when the user
    exits from X-windows or suntools.
Comment: [JHR]
	I was unable to reproduce this.  Perhaps there setup is such
	that a SIGHUP isn't getting generated.
Status: can't reproduce

503. illegal instruction -- core dumps

Date:		28.1.92
Version:	0.75
System:		Sparc 2 (4/50), 16M, SunOS
Severity:	Major, at least for me
Problem:
When running my compiled program, sml encounters an "illegal
instruction" and dumps core. When the program is interpreted,
there is a message
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error: Compiler bug: no default in interp
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
the bug seems to occur in a totally normal case expression. I am
currently trying to isolate the error, but would like to know whether
there is some special thing to look for. I use an sml image that
contains the full Edinburgh library; the code that dumps core is part
of the semantic rules of a parser written in sml-yacc. The code is
heavy with functionals.
Just to get an idea of what the code looks like, the function where
the error occurs is

Comment:
  when called, "mpdloop1" gets printed, then the error message appears.
  This is independent of the value of "x" (Atomic of Complex).
  As I said, am trying to reduce the error-generating code to manageable
  size and send that to you, but that may take a while.

This is a followup to my earlier message. The following code dumps

Comment:
  The main problem seems to be the type error at (*XXXX*): 
  "typtexprs" is of type "Texpr", so "typacterms" is a "TexprResult",
  not an "ACterm", as assumed by the "case x of Atomic...".

  This being undetected, a runtime error follows quite naturally. Funny
  enough, if the "Apply" clause in "indStringList" is removed by some
  simple rhs that doesn't inspect the argument of the Apply, no runtime error
  occurs.

  PS. After having found the type error, the function runs fine. Guess
  that makes the Severity "minor, at least for me".

Comment:
    After looking at cps/generic.sml, I think the problem is with generating code
    with immediate data.  Often, things like (INT u) op v get translated into
    <machine op> (immed (u+u)) v, where the u+u is for the boxity scheme (the +1
    comes from v).  But when u is already near the limit, then u+u overflows.
    Obviously, it would be nice for this to get fixed.

513. not waiting for execute children
Submitter: Robert S. Thau (rst@ai.mit.edu)
Date: 1/20/92
Version: ?
Severity: major
Problem: 
  SML/NJ appears not to wait for children forked off by execute.  This can be
  a problem in certain circumstances.  In my particular case, I wrote a
  routine which draws graphs for the user by forking off an xplot and sending
  down plot commands.  After fifty graphs or so, the zombie xplots had
  completely filled my per-user process limit, making it difficult to
  determine the nature of the problem (ps: cannot fork: no more processes).

  In this particular case, I'd be more than willing to do the wait myself,
  but execute gives me no process-id to wait for, just the input and output
  streams. 

  [from Phil Jeffcock <P.J.Jeffcock@bradford.ac.uk>, 3/2/92]
  I'm running SML/NJ 0.75 on my SUN Sparc IPC. I've been writing an application
  which I need to use execute frequently and in doing so the ML runtime is
  creating a zombie process each time I use it. After a short while I run out
  of process slots. Any ideas?
Fix:
  just before doing the execute, do wait3(&status,WNOHANG,NULL) to clean
  up previous children, if any.

514. uncaught exception ErrorStructure

      [closing join.sml]

      uncaught exception ErrorStructure
      - 

    I tried a few small examples, but I wasn't able to reproduce the

      structure AmberLrVals = AmberLrValsFun (structure Token = LrParser.Token)
      structure AmberLex = AmberLexFun (structure Tokens = AmberLrVals.Tokens)
      structure AmberParser = Join (
	structure ParserData = AmberLrVals.ParserData
	structure Lex = AmberLex
	structure LrParser = LrParser)

    If I add a ";" to the first line, then I just get the error message.

  [from Jon Thackray <jont@harlqn.co.uk>, 4/8/92]:
     Ok, here's a stripped down version of the ErrorStructure problem. I
  don't believe it can get any smaller. The significant factors seems to
  be twofold, firstly, the missing parameter to the Mir_Utils functor,
  and secondly the sharing constraint between the parameters of this
  functor. The first factor in isolation is not sufficient to produce
  the problem, as far as I can tell. Hope this helps.

  signature MIRTYPES =
    sig
    end;

  signature MIRPRINT =
    sig
      structure MirTypes	: MIRTYPES
    end;

  functor Mir_Utils(
    structure MirTypes : MIRTYPES
    structure MirPrint : MIRPRINT

    sharing MirTypes = MirPrint.MirTypes
  ) =

  This seems to happen a lot when using ctrl-c to halt a looping or long
  running program. Even if this doesn't happen, the image sometimes
  seems corrupt afterwards, in that it exhibits strange (impossible)
  behaviour that doesn't occur if it is recompiled from scratch to
  supposedly the same state. I suspect there is a critcial region

Problem: 
  I'm sorry to bother you with such a vague problem but I'm having a
  little trouble with your compiler under IRIX.  We've just upgraded from
  Irix 3.3.x to version 4.0.1 and since then any attempt to use the "use"
  function made SML 0.75 hang. I tried to re-compile the runtime but then
  it only gets as far as [Executing IEEEReal] before it hangs again. I've
  done a little diddling and as far as I can tell it's hung in prim.s.
  Any suggestions on where to start looking or whom to contact?

523. printing uncaught exceptions
Submitter:      Richard O'Neill <richard@smaug.questor.wimsey.bc.ca>
Date:		Thu Feb 27 14:32:47 PST 1992
Version:        0.75
System:         NeXTstation, OS2.1
Severity:       Major annoyance
Problem:        
If a value happens to be of type exn, the top level loop won't
print out the value, but instead says 'val it = exn : exn'; this
is not acceptable behaviour in my opinion.

When debugging, I like to be able to pass back information when an
fatal exception is raised. It is bad enough that if you have:

	exception InvalidKey of int;
  ...
	raise InvalidKey 6502;

it gives the message

	uncaught exception InvalidKey
and not:
	uncaught exception: InvalidKey 6502

(But the 'Io' exception does 'do the right thing'- special case
treatment or what :o)

But I can put up with that - what really annoys me is that even
the top level won't print exception values, i.e.

	- val theException = InvalidKey 6502;
	val theException = exn : exn

In order to find the value, I need to do:

	- case theException of InvalidKey key => key;
	std_in:3.1-3.42 Warning: match not exhaustive
		InvalidKey key => ...
	val it = 6502 : int

This is annoying, because it means more work for me to do, especially
if the datastructure is a *chain* of exception values (e.g. something
like 'exception ReraiseBacktrace of functionName * parameters *
exn' - you get the idea anyway). In such a case, I have to follow
the chain *by hand*.

I realise that printing exeptions may be harder than printing
ordinary constructors, but don't think this is a good reason not
to print them.

[Richard O'Neill, 11/24/92]
Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.92, November 18, 1992
val it = () : unit
- val some_exceptions = [Interrupt, Match, Bind, Io "Foobar"];
val some_exceptions = [exn,exn,exn,exn] : exn list
- ^D

If a value happens to be of the exception type, it is always printed
in a most uninformative way.

Obviously, I'd like to see:

Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.93, February 17, 1993 ;-)
val it = () : unit
- val some_exceptions = [Interrupt, Match, Bind, Io "Foobar"];
val some_exceptions = [Interrupt, Match, Bind, Io "Foobar"] : exn list
- ^D

Thus bug already has a number, 523, but the title "printing uncaught
exceptions" is misleading, and I expect probably the reason it hasn't
been fixed (yet). (Better printing of uncaught exceptions would be nice
too, but that is far less important to me).

Unless I'm seriously mistaken, this bug would only take minutes to fix, for
someone who knows SML-NJ's data-structures.

Comment: (awa)
Fixed a little bit; exn values now print a top level, but not the
value carried by the constructor.

Status: not entirely a bug

524. weak polymorphism
Submitter: shail@au-bon-pain.lcs.mit.edu (Shail Aditya)
Date: 12/19/91
Version: ?
Severity: major
Problem: 
	  I ran across this quirk in the ranked weak type inference in
  SML-NJ. I am running the version 0.75 on Sparc (sunos). 

  - val g3 = (fn f => (fn x => f x));
  val g3 = fn : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b

  - g3 ref;
  std_in:5.1-5.6 Error: nongeneric weak type variable
    it : '0Z -> '0Z ref
  -

  The "ref" does not happen until another argument is supplied to "g3
  ref", so proper ranking analysis should have made its type to be 
  "'1a -> '1a ref" without any error.

  - val g = (fn x => x);
  val g = fn : 'a -> 'a
  - g ref;
  std_in:3.1-3.5 Error: nongeneric weak type variable
    it : '0Z -> '0Z ref

  But the following works.

  - val h = (fn x => let val g = fn x => x in g ref end);
  val h = fn : 'a -> '1b -> '1b ref
  -  val h = (fn x => let val g = (fn f => (fn x => f x)) in g ref end);
  val h = fn : 'a -> '1b -> '1b ref
  - 

  Basically, it seems that "ref" is opened up to the enclosing lambda
  rank unnecessarily when it is passed as an argument. This system works
  fine in first order situations but fails in higher order argument
  passing when the arguments are weakly polymorphic functions. 

  Am I to understand that the ranked system of SML-NJ is not powerful
  enough to keep track of weak polymorphism across higher order function
  applications? Or is this merely a bug? 

  I would like to obtain a clearer description of the ranked system you
  follow. Preferably in terms of a paper that gives the inference rules.
  I have a system that behaves similarly, only that it allows toplevel
  non-ground weak types as well. I would like to know the SML-NJ
  solution better. Do you have any pointers? 
Status: not a bug (a "feature" of weak polymorphism)

526. Harlequin gripes
Submitter: Andrew Tolmach
Date: 3/2/92
Version: 0.75
Severity: minor
Problem: 
  1) If one uses polymorphic equality on, say, integer types, the equality test
  is much slower than using a type-specific equality operator.  This was probably
  in the context of functors, in which case its no big surprise, but might
  bear looking into further.

  2) They were unhappy with the time cost of referencing elements out of
  structures at runtime.  They often do something like inserting an explicit
  declaration

    val thing = A.thing

  same thing for them automatically.  They also suggested that we don't tend
  to notice this problem because we use "open" all over the place, a practice
  they abominate.

  [Bob Harper, 4/10/92]:
  Dave Tarditi suggested that the constructor printing problem might be due to
  the fact that something or other got reversed in the code generator, but this
  was forgotten in the print routines.  Apparently some representation is now
  done in reverse order.

  I consistently get the following behavior:
  1. Build a system using SourceGroup.make.
  2. Open a particular structure, making available a constructor Abs (among
     many others).
  3. Modify things, do another make.
  4. Uses of Abs suddenly get weird type errors.  Typing Abs at top level
     results in "val it = exn : exn".

  I could send the whole system, but this seems excessive....

In summary, I do three `use "load"' starting with no bin files.  The
first gives no error, but i get <erro> types (what does that mean).
Second time a recompile is needed (odd?) and get a Compiler bug:

On the third try, no recompile needed, but get same compiler bug

Comments:  I see from the compiler that LOCAL specs are only partially
implemented, so this is probably the cause, though i dont get the
<error> bit.  As I am new to modules in ML, its all probably
meaningless code anyway, but I thought I ought to drop you a line.

529. memory leak
Submitter: schristensen@daimi.aau.dk (Soren Christensen)
Date: 3/20/92
Version: 0.75
Severity: major
Problem: 
  I have a problem that my system slows down after running a short while.
  Instead of using the ordinary top-loop of the compiler I run my own. This
  means that I evaluate ML code in the following way:

  use_stream (open_string "code");

  It seems that this construct creates 16 bytes of "garbage" which is never
  collected.

  My first idea was that I needed to close the stream which is created, i.e.,

  let
    val is = open_string "code"
  in
   use_stream is;
   close_in is
  end;

  But this does not fix the problem.

  It seems that "close_in is" have no effect. At least it reports no errors
  when a use_string is performed on a stream which has been closed.

532. squaring big real number dumps core on sparc (see also 638)

Severity: 
Problem: 
  To repeat this, just attempt to square 1.0E~160 on your nearest sparcstation
  in SML/NJ.  The process will die, complaining that "underflow should not trap".
Fix:
  As I read the source code, the machine-independant signal-handling code (in
  signal.c) expects floating point underflows not to trap, but the machine-
  dependant code does enable underflow trapping.  Accordingly, here's a
  one-line fix to SPARC.dep.c in the runtime directory:

533. typing record types
Submitter:      Richard O'Neill <richard@smaug.questor.wimsey.bc.ca>
Date:		Tue Mar 24 17:54:13 PST 1992
Version:        0.75 (and 0.73, don't know about 0.78)
System:         NeXTstation, OS2.1 & Sun4 SunOS 4.1.1.
Severity:       Major
Problem:        


The type system is *broken* w.r.t. record types. The problem is tied in
with use of flex records (but I do NOT mean the 'unresolved flex record
in let pattern' business that novice programmers sometimes fail to
understand).  The type checker gives an incorrect (too general) typing
for valid SML.  A very minor change causes a correct typing to be given.

The best way to show this bug is to give some code that reproduces it:

   (*
    * The compiler incorrectly types this function as:
    * {key:''a,value:'b} list -> {key:''a,value:'c} -> {key:''a,value:'b} list
    * 						 ^--- should be 'b
    *)
    

    fun insert1 alist (item as {key=desired, ...}) =
	let				  (* ^--- remember this bit *)
	    fun worker nil = item :: nil
	      | worker ({key,value} :: items) =
		if key = desired then
		    item :: items
		else
		    worker items
	in
	    (worker alist)
	end

   (*
    * The compiler correctly types this function as:
    * {key:''a,value:'b} list -> {key:''a,value:'b} -> {key:''a,value:'b} list
    * 						 ^--- correct
    *)
    

    fun insert2 alist (item as {key=desired, value = _}) =
	let				  (* ^--- the only difference *)
	    fun worker nil = item :: nil
	      | worker ({key,value} :: items) =
		if key = desired then
		    item :: items
		else
		    worker items
	in
	    (worker alist)

535. Problems with non-equality types (bug or language problem?) (see also 341)
Submitter:      Richard O'Neill <richard@smaug.questor.wimsey.bc.ca>
Date:		Wed Mar 25 09:41:51 PST 1992

Severity:       Major
Problem:        

I'm not sure if this is a bug or a language 'feature' - whatever it is,
it is certainly unnecessarily restrictive and needs fixing...

If I have a reference to a type that does not admit equality, I can
still test  *references* to that type for equality. But, if that reference
is wrapped up as part of a structured type, I cannot.

It isn't necessarily tied to references. It also applies to any parametric
types which don't actually contain an element of the type, such as:
	datatype 'a type_only = TypeOnly

Take a look at the transcript below...

   of variables.  If parsing is made a bit more complicated, this static
   analysis can be done on the fly during parsing and only the second form
   of variable would be needed (this is how it is currently done in the ML

(* it will probably be more convenient to have a smaller number of
   cases in the expression datatype.  One way of reducing the number
   of expression constructs is to have an APP constructor that takes
   an "operator" and a list of argument expressions.  If the set of
   possible operators is fixed, then they may be defined as the
   constructors of an operator datatype, as below.  If new operators
   can be introduced, then a more complicated operator type would be
   appropriate.  You might look at src/absyn/bareabsyn.sml to see how
   the ML abstract syntax is defined.

   Each operator needs to be assigned its arity, and when constructing
   an expression, or when checking its "well-formedness" (a mild form
   of type checking), one would verify that the length of the argument
   list matches the arity of the operator.

   For proper type checking, each operator would be assigned a type,
   which would presumably subsume its arity.

540. printing hanging on Mach
Submitter: Bob Harper
Date: 4/2/92
Version: 0.78
System: DecStation 5000, Mach, running over telnet
Severity: major
Problem: 
  Type "structure S = System".
  On my machine it prints about halfway through, then hangs.
Comment:
  Sometimes when running sml over a telnet, the printing hangs.  You can
  continue by typing space.  This is not new to 0.78. [Gene Rollins]

  [Bob Harper, 4/11/92]:
  Incidentally, on the PMAX (at least) I consistently get the following
  behavior.  I type in something, particularly something that incurs a type
  error.  I get back half or three quarters of a message, then it hangs.  The
  only way out is to type ^C, which gets me back to the prompt.  If I type the
  same thing again, I may or may not get the full message.  Often I just kill
  the session and start over, then it works (for a while).  We're running Mach
  on the PMAX, and I'm using ML via telnet, within an emacs ML interaction
  window, if it matters.

  There seems to be a more grneral problem in 0.80. The toplevel environment
  seems to grow - even if I do not declare new names. Now that I can inspect
  the valuse in the environmet I find "VAL$it" repeted.
  try:

  (System.Env.staticPart (!System.Env.topLevelEnvRef)));

Version:        81
System:         mips (It doesn't occur on the sun4)
Severity:       major
Problem:     1) In gnu emacs, sml goes into an infinite loop when I hit the 
                interrupt key, i.e., on the DEL character. Then sml seems to
                ignore signals: the only way to regain control is to kill the
                sml process. Merely exiting emacs will not kill the sml 
                process.

             2) A related problem is that interrupt doesn't give the right
                exception (and not until a carriage return): it returns the
                Abort exception.

uncaught exception Match

Comment: I guess this shouldn't happen. It's not the sort of
thing I type regularly, I was prompted to do it by the compiler's
habit of inserting = all over the place when it thinks I've left out
an identifier.

  metasparc 142 :
Comments:
  536870912 seems to be 2^29. (Similar behaviour, of course, for 
  corresponding negative numbers.)

  This compiler was build with 'makeml -noshare' on a Sun4, but
  compilers build with 'makeml' have same behaviour.

  In SML/NJ v0.80 this is no problem. Here integers can be 
  up to (2^30)-1 and it doesn't give 'Illegal instruction'.

       allocates 1 word from heap and later saves a pointer to it (fpregs). 
       this word should contain a descriptor (len 0,tag string): 
Fix:
       (MAKE_DESC(NSAVED_FPREGS*8,tag_string)) 
       as is done in _savefpregs for the M68, MIPS.  
       (VAX is same as Sparc).

Comments:
        I have a another question on the new calling conventions 
        (CALLEESAVE) for sparc.
        If register masks in code strings don't contain the 
        CLOSURE_INDX the last bit is 0. 
        A mask then either looks like a pointer or an int.
        Does this not affect the garbage collector?

Transcript:     loadFile hangs during execute; sending an interrupt

Comments:       This program works fine in 0.80. Changes made to
                blast_read and blast_write in 0.81 are probably the
                root of the problem. The above program also failed
                in 0.81b, but hung during blast_read. This was mentioned
                to Lal, who, I believe, produced 0.81c as a partial fix.

561. exportFn images too big (same as 489)
Submitter: Andrew Koenig
Date: 5/19/92
Version: 0.75
System: Sparc
Severity: minor
Problem: 
  For practical reasons, it would be nice to get
  exportFn to create less bulky executables for small programs.
  For example, here is a somewhat simplified version of the
  `echo' command:

	  fun echo [] = print "\n"
	    | echo (h::nil) = print (h^"\n")
	    | echo (h::t) = (print(h ^ " "); echo t)

	  fun main(argv, envp) = echo(tl argv)

  When I use `exportFn' to make an executable of this, it takes
  136 kbytes using 0.53 on a 10th Edition machine.  Using 0.75
  on a Sparcstation, the executable is 471 kbytes.  Even if we
  allow that Sparc executables are bigger, it is hard to believe
  that that much baggage is truly necessary.
[from ark, 12/1/92:]
  I just built 0.92 and gave it a try.
  When built with -noshare, the following

	  fun main _ = print "Hello world\n";
	  exportFn ("xxx", main);

  yields a 946K executable with 860K of loadable data.
  This is as opposed to 376K/249K with 0.75,
  which in turn was about twice as big as 0.43.
[from Lal, 12/16/92]
  We mercifully had the result of exportFn for the lego theorem
  prover using version 0.66. So I built a noshare version of sml
  for the Sparc and rebuilt lego using version 0.92.

  There is more than a Mbyte increase in the size of the exported 
  image. Below, Olego is the image under 0.66, and lego is the version
  under 0.92.

  Either this is to be expected - which is bad, or there are references
  that are not being cleared - which is also bad.

562. SML hanging under telnet (under Mach) (also #540)
Submitter:      tsf@cs.cmu.edu
Date:		Tue May 19 15:14:55 1992
Version:        0.80
System:         Pmax, running Mach.  Also Sun 4's running mach, but
		more rarely.  (I'm referring to the type of the
		machine running SML, not the type of the machine
		running telnet.) 
Severity:       minor
Problem:        When running under telnet, sml intermittently hangs on output.
Code:           Anything that produces lots of output will do.
Transcript:     It's long, so I put it at the end of this message.
		It's not very informative. 
Comments:	If I say "sml | cat -u" instead of "sml", things work
		fine.  If I create a remote xterm and run sml within
		that, or a remote gnu-emacs and run sml within that,
		things work fine.  The problem only happens when sml's
		standard output is a pty controlled by telnet.

		The type of the machine running sml seems to make
		more of a difference than the type of the machine at
		the other end of the telnet connection.
Fix:		Say "sml | cat -u" instead of "sml" to invoke sml at
		the other end of a telnet connection.

Looking at the code for flushbuf in boot/perv.sml, I see that you wait
for output to become possible before sending the first bytes of
output, but inside the loop in write_all in runtime/cfuns.c, you don't
wait for output to become possible after a partial write.  This
discrepancy is strange, but I don't see how it could give rise to this
bug.  Do you use nonblocking IO?  Why do you wait for output to become
possible before starting a write?

I wouldn't be surprised if telnet is the only device you output to
that doesn't always write all of the bytes you ask it to.

Here's the transcript.  The details don't matter much, anything that
produces this much chatter is very likely to hang.  This works fine
when run locally or when piped through "cat -u".

Comments:

"label <2> has moved" is printed by the LISP fn replace-all-label-definitions.
It gets confused because there are more than one label on a line (this
kind of lines with multible labels are produced by the (new) macro 
"CHECKLIMIT" in M68.prim.s).

Fix:

Replace replace-all-label-definitions with the following fn: (the fix does
the following: instead of moving to the beginning of the line in order
to search for the label, the pointer is only moved 2 chars to the left
of the label.)

Probably the easiest fix for this is to change the CHECKLIMIT macro to

#define CHECKLIMIT                                      \
            1: 						\
               jgt      2f;                             \
               lea      1b,a5;                          \
               rts;                                     \
            2:

[Mortensen:]
I don't think this will work since /lib/cpp on the HP9000s400 (at least
on ours) converts CHECKLIMIT into

  1: jgt 2f; lea 1b,a5; rts; 2:

If sun2hp.el is fixed, anybody can make changes to M68.prim.s without
having to remember that multible labels on a line are not allowed, just
because the translator algorithm in sun2hp.el cannot handle it.

Comments (+Fix?):

The intruction "jpl" is not know to the sun2hp translator (in fn do-subst).
I don't know what jpl is supposed to do, but my _guess_ is that it should
be translated into the branch instruction "bpl.w" (anologious to transl.
of jeq, jge, ... etc.).

Shouldn't the line

  (replace-re "\\<jpl" "bpl.w")

be added to the fn do-subst in sun2hp.el?

Problem: 
  On large compilations (e.g. compiling the compiler) on sparcs that
  are shared with other large jobs (e.g. lisp or another sml), the
  compiler will die with a bus error or illegal instruction or something
  equally drastic.  This is fairly consistent.

  Can this be avoided by forcing sml to grap a large memory chunk for

570. flexrecord equality types
Submitter:      Mark Lillibridge (mdl@cs.cmu.edu)
Date:		6/8/92
Version:        0.82
System:         RISC O/S, MIPS (?)
Severity:       minor
Problem:        Flexrecords are always assumed to contain non-equality
		types when this need not be so.  This leads to legal
		programs being rejected.
Code:           Consider the following code:

	fun force_record {x=x, y=y} = 3;

	fun force_eq x = (x = x);

		Then, the following function types ok since we close the
flexrecord before requiring equality:

	fun bar (r as {x=x, ...}) = (force_record r; force_eq r);

		But the following function fails with a "equality type
required" error because we attempt to require that the open flexrecord
be an equality type:

	fun foo (r as {x=x, ...}) = (force_eq r; force_record r);

Transcript:     

- use "bug.sml";	(* same code as above *)
val force_record = fn : {x:'a,y:'b} -> int
val force_eq = fn : ''a -> bool
val bar = fn : {x:''a,y:''b} -> bool
bug.sml:7.29-7.56 Error: operator and operand don't agree (equality type required)
  operator domain: ''Z
  operand:         {x:'Y,...}
  in expression:
    force_eq r
[closing bug.sml]

Comments:	This problem is due to incorrect code in the type-handling
part of the SML/NJ compiler.  Fixing this will require changing the
definition of types so that flexrecords carry a boolean telling if they
are required to have only equality types or not.  Unify then needs to be
updated to use this information in the proper way.

571. no occurs check when instantiating flexrecords
Submitter:      Mark Lillibridge (mdl@cs.cmu.edu)
Date:		6/8/92
Version:        0.82
System:         RISC O/S, MIPS (?)
Severity:       minor
Problem:        When flexrecords are instantiated (additional fields
		added/closed), no occurs check is done.  The failure to
		do this can result in cyclic types and hanging the type
		checker.
Code:           The following code hangs the typechecker:

	fun foo {x=x, y=y, z=(z as {...})} = foo z;

Transcript:     
	- fun foo {x=x, y=y, z=(z as {...})} = foo z;
	[hangs here, using more and more space forever]

		an occurs check whenever it instantiates a flex record.

572. unify doesn't update depth for flex record types
Submitter:      Mark Lillibridge (mdl@cs.cmu.edu)
Date:		6/8/92
Version:        0.82
System:         RISC O/S, MIPS (?)
Severity:       major			(* can result in unsoundness *)
Problem:        The unify routine in the SML/NJ compiler fails to update
		the depth fields of variables when dealing with flex
		records.  This causes the type checker to generalize
		types that should not be generalized.
Code:           Many examples are possible.  The simplest I can
		think of is:

		fun snd {a,b} = b;

		fun f (x as {a,...}) =
			let val u = snd x
			in
			    u
			end;

		Here, snd has type {a:'a,b:'b} -> 'b and acts to extract
		the b field of an a-b record.

		So, we start out defining function f.  The (x as
		{a,...}) in the argument list causes x to be bound to
		the type {a: 'a#1, ...}.  [#i means the variable has
		depth i.  I am assuming for this discussion that depths
		start with 1 and go up 1 for each lambda level.]

		Now, in the let val u = snd x, we have to unify the type
		of x with the argument type of snd, namely {a:'c,b:'b}.
		This results in x being bound to type {a:'a#1, b:'b#2}.
		Note the error here.  Type 'b should have depth 1 not 2
		since it is bound at the 1st lambda level (by variable
		x).  However, due to incorrect code in the unifier, this
		doesn't happen and 'b has type 2.

		Thus, when we finish typing the function body we get the
		type 'b#2, which the depth indicates can be safely
		generalized.  Thus, the function body has polymorphic
		type 'c.  This results in f getting type {a:'a, b:'b} ->
		'c when it should have the type {a:'a, b:'b} -> 'b.

Transcript:     

	- fun snd {a,b} = b;
	val snd = fn : {a:'a,b:'b} -> 'b
	- fun f (x as {a,...}) = let val u = snd x in u end;
	val f = fn : {a:'a,b:'b} -> 'c
	- f {a=0, b=true};
	val it = - : 'a

Comments:	The problem is in the handling of types by the SML/NJ
		compiler.  Flexrecords need to have a depth associated
		with them just like normal variables.  This is so that
		you can unify {a:'a#1, ...#1} with {a:'c#3, b:'d#3} and
		get {a:'a#1, b:'d#1} not {a:'a#1, b:'d#3}.  (Note the
		depth associated with the dots in that example.  This is
		the critical information missing from the current type
		representation.)
		
Related-bugs:	Bug reports #521 from Mark Leone, #533 from Richard
		O'Neill, and #569 from jont@uk.co.harlqn are all just

573. unifier detects spurious cycles with type abbrevs

Version:        0.82
System:         RISC O/S, MIPS (?)
Severity:       minor
Problem:        The unifier's occurs check sometimes detects a spurious
		cycle when a type variable is unified with a type
		abbreviation that stands for that type variable.
Code:           
		type 'a ID = 'a;

		fun f (x:'a) = (x:'a ID);

		fun g x = g (f x);

Transcript:

	- type 'a ID = 'a;
	type 'a  ID = 'a

The reason is that cons is tagged with UNTAGGEDREC 2 and the case UNTAGGEDREC
is not treated by the switch.
Lal and I have infered that the only thing the switch interpretor had to
figure out is whether the constructor is tagged or not. So the only necessary
lines to add are:
-cregut->diff codegen/interp.sml /usr/local/sml/77/src/codegen/interp.sml

291,296d290

<                in fn x => if (U.boxed x) then ans' else rest' x
<               end

Is it true or do we need something else ?

577. use of vectors crashes NeXT
Submitter:      Richard O'Neill <richard@smaug.questor.wimsey.bc.ca>
Date:		Thu Jun 18 13:24:53 PDT 1992
Version:        0.75
System:         NeXTstation, OS2.1  and NeXTstation Turbo Color, OS 2.2.
Severity:       Major.
Problem:        

Extensive use of vectors (and probably arrays) when running on NeXTs
causes SML to crash with either "Bus Error", "Segmentation Fault",
"Illegal instruction" or "EMT trap". The same code, when run on SPARC
based Sun machines does not exhibit the same problem.

The code below creates a function called 'bug', which takes an integer
argument. The larger the argument, the more likely SML is to crash,
values like 10000 create an almost immediate crash, values such as 500
sometimes work and sometimes crash SML. (The code is for example purposes
only, I don't actually use code as inefficient as this normally! ;o)

Code (stored in file "bug.sml"):

    open Vector

    fun update(array,index,value) = 
	let
	    fun copy i = 

		if i = index then value
		else sub(array,i)
	    val size = length array
	in
	    if index < size then
		tabulate (size,copy)
	    else
		raise Vector.Subscript
	end

    fun reverse original =
	let
	    val size = length original
	    fun rev (current,count) =
		if count < size then
		    let
			val count'  = count + 1
			val current' =
			    update(current, count, sub(original, size-count'))
		    in
			rev (current', count')
		    end
		else current
	in
	    rev (original,0)
	end

    fun bug n = reverse (tabulate (n, fn x => x))

Comments:

It gives an idea how 'wild' the crash is since the latter two cases in
the transcript should be identical, and aren't. I suspect it is some
kind of memory allocation bug, but who knows....

Comment: [dbm, 10/29/92]
  Couldn't reproduce this on a Sun 3 with 0.91.  Either the bug is
  cured or it is NeXT specific.

578. chatting (in runtime system) doesn't flush stdout
Submitter:      Mark Leone (mleone@cs.cmu.edu)
Date:           June 24, 1992
Version:        80
System:         all
Severity:       minor
Problem:        chatting() doesn't flush stdout
Code:           
Transcript:     
Comments:	GC messages (and other diagnostic compiler output)
		sometimes appear before things that have already been 
		printed to stdout  (e.g. when redirecting batch compiler 
		output to a log file).  This can make it hard to debug 
		the compiler.

579. Lexing an illegal token can lead to infinite loop
Submitter:      Andrew Tolmach (apt@research.att.com)
Date:		30 June
Version:        0.83
System:         MIPS and SPARC
Severity:       
Problem:        Lexing an illegal token can lead to infinite loop.
Code:           Typing an arbitrary control character (such as CTRL/A),
		followed by return, sends system into an infinite loop.
Transcript:     - ^A
		std_in:0.0 Error: illegal token
		... (infinite loop) ...
Comments:	(1) Looping doesn't occur if illegal token is followed by a 
			complete legal phrase, e.g., ^A1;
		(2) Loop can be interrupted with CTRL/C.
		(3) Didn't occur in 0.82.
Fix: 
  Exception handler in ml.lex.sml uses Reject instead of Internal.Reject
  when Internal is not open, thus producing a handler for all exceptions.
  Change Reject to Internal.Reject in lexgen.

Date:		7 July 92
Version:        0.83
System:         MIPS riscos
Severity:       minor
Problem:        If an open declaration is evaluated by 
		System.Compile.eval_stream, the resulting first-class
		environment is inconsistent: the static environment
		contains the elements of the opened structure, but the
		structure itself is not included in the dynamic environment.
		Subsequent attempts to look up these elements in the
		first-class environment trigger IntMapF exceptions.

Fix: (suggested by Tolmach)
	A top-level open should create a new structure entry in the 
	dynamic environment, and paths for entries in the static 
	environment should be adjusted to point at this new entry.
Fix: (implemented in 0.91)
  A top-level open causes all the runtime components of the structures
  opened to be rebound in the top-level environment.

Comment: [Cregut]
The bug can be obtained by the simple following code:

signature A=sig end
signature B=sig functor f():A end;

and comes from the fact that A is declared before so contains
no arguments. The fix is a 3 lines changed in extern.sml that
ask the function not to worry if the argument is not there.
It should be in .85

Comments:	the error messages should indicate which labels are a) ok, b)
		extra/mispelled, c) missing.  also, (and this is a problem in
		general with type error messages), the field type mismatches
		should be highlighted, as just "tycon mismatch" gives one no
		idea where the mismatch is.

Fix:		use some kind of field by field comparison of the pattern and
		expression (a 2-column format, while verbose, might work well),
		perhaps first listing all fields that match, then listing all
		labels with mismatched types, then extra labels in the
		expression, then (possibly even for flex records) omitted
		labels.

605. whose bug?
Submitter:      Charles Krasic
		cckrasic@plg.waterloo.edu
Date:		July 31, 1992
Version:        0.75
System:         Sparc, SunOS 4.1.2
Severity:       critical
Problem:        file compiles OK with batch compiler, but runtime/run
 	        fails with "uncaught exception (Loader): Syntax"
Comments:	I am working on the source code of NJSML itself.  I have made some
		fairly significant changes so it would be a non-trivial amount of
		work for me to give you all the code necessary to run NJSML and 
		reproduce my problem.   I have isolated my problem to 1 line of code
		in the source code which is will briefly summarize here.  The 
		file that contains the code in question is at the end of this message.
		This code is part of my modified type checker.  Roughly, it is
		called prior to the 0.75 typechecker (there are many changes...)

		This seems to be a very nasty bug to me. It should be noted that, while 
		I am changing the compiler, I am compiling my changed version with the 
		stock 0.75 version of the batch compiler.  My changes are confined
		entirely to the front end of the compiler (nothing after typechecking).

		Some of the things I tried:	

		The offending section of code is:

1.		(case var of
2.		    (VALvar{constraints,...}) => 
3.			(ConstraintsStack.push constraints;
4.			 constructList := (constraints :: (!constructList));
5.			 expType(env,exp,err,loc); 
6.			 ConstraintsStack.pop())
7.		  | _ => (ErrorMsg.impossible "MakeImplicitsPass.Pass2.valrecType"))

		If lines 3,4 and 6 are removed (and 5 has the semicolon removed), it
		will build OK.  Alternatively, if line 5 is removed, it also will
		build OK.  Of course, either of those things doesn't do what I want
		it to do.  I have tried many variations on the above code but could
		not get any to work.

606. Allocating space for saved FP registers is awkward
Submitter:      Mark Leone (mleone@cs.cmu.edu)
Date:		July 31, 1992
Version:        0.82
System:         i386
Severity:       Necessary change for i386 runtime
Problem:        Allocating space for saved FP registers is awkward
Code:           none
Transcript:	none
Comments:
   In runtime/signal.c, in make_ml_sigh_arg(), floating point registers
   are saved as follows:

   #if (NSAVED_FPREGS > 0)
       savefpregs (msp);
       fpregs = PTR_CtoML(msp->ml_allocptr + sizeof(long));
       msp->ml_allocptr += (NSAVED_FPREGS*2 + 1) * sizeof(long);
   #else
       ...

   This code assumes that savefpregs only needs NSAVED_FPREGS*2 + 1
   words.  This assumption fails on the 386, since the entire FP
   coprocessor state must be saved, not just the registers.  

Fix:		
   A better approach is for savefpregs() to update the allocptr itself
   and return a pointer to the saved state:

   #if (NSAVED_FPREGS > 0)
       fpregs = savefpregs (msp);
   #else
       ...
Comment: [jhr]
  A better fix might be introducing a machine dependent constant for the
  fp-save area size.  Also, savefpregs should probably get the save area
  pointer as its argument, since this would simplify the assembly code
  a bit.

610. changeLvars broken
Submitter: Gene Rollins
Date: 8/5/92
Version: 0.87
Severity: major (for separate compilation)
Problem: 
  There is a compiler bug in SML/NJ 0.85 and 0.87 that is not present in 0.80.
  I tracked it down to this: the function changeLvars when applied to
  a staticUnit sometimes eliminates bindings to fixity symbols.  So, if you try
  to read a compiled binary file, and then compile a file that uses symbols
  defined in the binary file, you sometimes get an error such as this:

      a.sig:1.15-1.19 Error: FIRST undefined (parser)

  If the symbol is really undefined you also get this message:
      a.sig:1.15-1.19 Error: unbound signature: FIRST

  This happens on pmax_mach and sun4_mach machines.  I found that once you have
  a binary file that this bug happens with, it is repeatable.  But, not all
  binary files tickle this bug.

616. overloading versus user-bound type variable
Submitter: Lars Birkedal <birkedal@diku.dk>
Date: 8/12/92
Version: 0.87 (and earlier)
Severity: minor
Problem: 
  I assume you resolve arithmetic overloading in NJSml by 
  binding the operators, such as +, to a generel type-scheme, such 
  as \forall 'a. 'a *'a -> 'a, where the type-variables are marked
  as overloaded, and then elaborates as usual with the exception
  that overloaded type variables are not allowed to be quantified. 
  (Some examples I've run indicates this.)

  The following example seems to indicate that you allow unification of
  overloaded type variables with explicit type variables and when
  unifying marks the explicit type variables as overloaded. This mark
  prohibits quantification of the explicit type variable at its scoping
  declaration, hence violating rule 17 in the Definition.  My question
  is --- why allow unification of overloaded typevariables with explict
  type variables at all?; since quantification is not allowed,
  overlaoding cannot be resolved this way (as in let val f = fn x => x +
  x in f 2 end, which elaborates), so the only other way is to unify the
  explicit type variable with int or real, which is not allowed, hence
  overloading cannot be resolved this way either. So what do you gain?

Transcript: 
  - let val f = fn (x: 'a) => x + x in f 2 end;
  std_in:1.5-1.31 Error: explicit type variable cannot be generalized at its scoping declaration: 
  'a
  std_in:1.29 Error: overloaded variable "+" cannot be resolved

Comment: [dbm]
  The type variables of the type scheme of an overloaded variable are
  "marked as overloaded" when an instance of the type scheme is created
  for a particular applied occurence of the variable.  This marking is
  accomplished by a book-keeping device -- each type metavariable
  substituted for a bound variable of the scheme is given a "depth" of
  zero.  The depth attribute is used to determine whether a metavariable
  can be generalized at a val binding, and a depth of zero will prevent
  these metavariables (or metavariables in types substituted for them)
  from ever being generalized.

  When one of these metavariables is unified with a "user-bound" type
  variable like the 'a in your example, the depth of the metavariable is
  propagated to the user-bound variable, which in this case prevents the
  user-bound variable from being generalized at the appropriate place.
  This looks like a bug -- in fact, I think that the user-bound variable
  should probably not have a depth attribute at all.

Status: not a bug (but alternate handling might be better)

(script done on Thu Aug 13 11:47:39 1992)

Comments:

eq1 implements the equality check as a call to
polymorphic equality, while eq2 
inline expands the equality for the type int.

This is particularly obnoxious since, at least to me, 
the declaration of eq1 looks prettier.

622. Bus error on DECstation 5000/200
Submitter: Urban Engberg <urban@daimi.aau.dk>
Date: 8/18/92
Version: 0.75-0.80
System: DECstation 5000/200 and 5000/240
Severity: major
Problem: 
  I have been using SML of NJ for a couple of years, mostly for writing
  compiler-related tools.  The tool I am currently working on contains about 7000
  lines of sml-code, including the code produced by sml-lex and -yacc.  The
  relatively large size of the program seems essential to my problem to be
  described.

  When compiling the code, by reading in the files with "use", the sml system
  once in a while crashes with messages such as

    pid 22613 (tlac.orig) was killed on an unaligned access, at pc 0x100a3550
    Bus error (core dumped)

  The problem has been specific to running on DECstations 5000/200 and 5000/240
  (at least) but occurs on all the machines of this kind that I have tried.

  I have been able to bear over with the problems for some time, without trying
  to find the error, as I would just have to restart the compilation at the right
  point a couple of times.

  Lately, however, the problem has started showing up more and more often when I
  execute the binary image I create with the library-construct "exportFn".  As my
  code has been growing, I have now got a ratio of well-functioning runs to ones
  crashing of about 1:10!  Thus it is beginning to be a very big problem.

  [added 8/19/92]
  The problem occurs at random.  But running a compilation which takes about five
  seconds will currently produce the crash nine times out of ten.

  I am running Ultrix version 4.2A (Apr 92), which I suppose is one of the
  newest.  I remember having had problems all the time since I began using DEC
  machines though, since March 91.  You are quite right in that `unaligned
  access' errors seems to indicate some sort of Ultrix bug.
Comments: [George]
  This brings back memories of when I was bringing up the new MIPS
  code generator. The regression tester specifically, would run
  just fine on a MIPSEB but would crash once in a while in a 
  non-deterministic manner on a MIPSEL. The error message was 
  identical - unaligned access, at pc ...

  At the time, we concluded that this was an operating system related 
  problem, and not the fault of the generated code. Unfortunately, I 
  did not persist in getting to the root of the problem. I am not 
  able to reproduce the error as the regression tester being used
  is gone!!

  My suggestion would be to try a post v 0.82 release that had
  even less reliance on the operating system - i.e., any trapless gc
  version.

Followup: [Urban Engberg, 8/24/92]
  It has been making me curious that the errors lately doesn't seem to show up in
  other programs than my compiler (where it with earlier sml versions has been a
  problem with many programs, and also when compiling the compiler).  So with a
  good guess, I tried removing some calls I had to `IO.execute'.  This made a
  crucial difference; the compiler now runs without any problems.

  To help finding the error, it should be noted that the compiler works fine
  *with* the `IO.execute' commands, when run from within an interactive sml
  session.

  I have tried to reproduce the error in a smaller program, but without success.

  The calls to `IO.execute' looked as follows:

	  val (datestream, dummy) =
		      IO.execute ("/bin/csh", ["-cfb", 
				  "/bin/date +\"%a %h %d%H:%M 19%y\""])
	  val date = input (datestream, 21) before (close_in datestream;
						    close_out dummy)

627. blast-writing objects outside the heap leads to failure
Submitter: David Tarditi
Date: 8/21/92
Version: 0.88
Severity: major
Problem: 
  blast-write fails when given an object that is outside the
  heap.   The following program (for version 0.75, shareable) demonstrates this.
  You'll have to change the program slightly to run it in the latest version of
  the compiler, since the type of blast_read has changed.
Code: 
  structure blast =
      struct
	  val s = System.version
	  val outblast = fn () =>
	    let val outfd = open_out "testblast"
	     in (System.Unsafe.blast_write (outfd, s); close_out outfd)
	    end
	  val inblast = fn () =>
	    let val infd = open_in "testblast"
		val res : string = System.Unsafe.blast_read infd
		val _ = close_in infd
	    in
	      (print "Got back: "; print res; print " : from testblast\n")
	    end

	  val _ = outblast ()
	  val _ = inblast ()
  end

  structure blast :

      val outblast : unit -> unit
      val s : string
    end
  [closing /usr/dtarditi/tmp]
  val it = () : unit
Comments:
  In the shareable version of the compiler, where the code for the compiler
  is palced outside the heap, the string System.version ends up outside the
  heap.
Fix:
  The solution is to add a check to the code for blast-write, I think,
  for the case where the object being blasted out is a pointer that is outside
  the heap.
  [Tarditi, 8/21/92:]
  I remember there was some problem about import not working across 
  different compiled versions of the same compiler.  For example,
  I think import files created with a shareable version of the compiler
  caused the nonshared version to crash.   I've realized what the problem
  is, and it is worth noting down for future reference.

  The basic problem is that blast_write isn't fully generally, and only
  works with a particular executable.  If you blast-write an object which
  contains pointers that are outside the heap, the garbage collector
  just copies the pointers as though they were integers.   The problem is
  that with different executables, the objects outside the heap may not
  exist at all, may be different (that is, the pointer points to junk), or
  they may be at a different address.

  Think about what happens when you blast-write a function.   The function
  will most likely contain objects from the pervasive environment in its
  closure.  Suppose one of those objects from the pervasive environment
  is a closure.  It will contain a code pointer.  If the compiler is 
  shareable version, the code pointer will be outside the heap.  Now,
  if we try to read blast_read this function into a nonshareable version
  of the compiler, the code pointer will be junk!  

  Note that you'll have this problem even if only the runtime has been
  changed across executables.  This will change the address of code for
  the assembly language primitives, and the addresses of ML objects allocated
  as static C data structures.

  A possible solution to add a level of indirection between objects in the
  runtime system and blast-written objects.

  (1) give every possible ML object in the runtime system a unique name
  (2) when blast-writing an object, translate ML objects outside the heap to
      their unique names
  (3) when blast-reading an object, translate from the unique names back to the
      ML objects.

  We could hack something up to deal with the code strings for the pervasives
  being either in the heap or text segment.

  We'd have to put a limitation that you can only blast-read/blast-write objects
  outside the heap which are "registered" (i.e. you can't blast-write things
  like the code for the compiler).   At least things could fail gracefully
  instead of crashing.

Comments:

	There are two function declarations in
	translate/tempexpn.sml that (accidentally)
	exploit this bug.  They are the last two functions of
	the structure.  In the first case, the second argument needs
	to be uncurried, in the second case, the final clause
	needs a second wildcard pattern.  Similarly,
	the function labBranchOff in mips/mipsinstr.sml, needs
        a second wildcard pattern in its final clause's formal parameters.

	The problem occurs because no explicit test is ever made 
	to ensure that clauses have the same number of argument 
	patterns.  In elaborating a function declaration,
	the compiler produces something of the form

		fn x1 => ... => fn xn => case (x1, ..., xn) of
			p1 => e1
			.
			.
			.
			pm => em

	x1, ..., xn are distinct new variables.
	ei is the expression of the ith clause.
	n is the number of patterns in the *first* clause
	If the ith clause has r > 1 patterns (pi1, ..., pir), pi is the 
	the pattern (pi1, ..., pir).   If the ith clause has only
	one pattern, pi is that pattern.

	The type checker will detect most mis-matches between
	numbers of arguments --- e.g.,

		fun foo a b c = 4 
		  | foo a b = 5;
		std_in:7.17-7.31 Error: rules don't agree (tycon mismatch)
  		  expected: 'Z * 'Y * 'X -> int
  		  found:    'W * 'V -> int
  		  rule:
    		    (a,b) => 5

	but will not catch mis-matches between appropriately typed single 
	patterns and multiple patterns.  	
	
Fix:	Add a check that the number of formal parameters agrees in  
	each clause.  Rewriting checkFB in parse/astutils.sml as 
	follows should work, the compiler compiles itself to a fixpoint
	with it installed, but I have *not* tested the resulting code
	very thoroughly.   (Note that translate/tempexpn.sml and 
	mips/mipsinstr.sml need to be fixed too, as described above).

	fun checkFB(clauses as ({name,pats,...}:rawclause)::rest, err) = 
	      let 
	        val patslen = length pats
      	      in 
		if exists (fn {name=n,...} => not(Symbol.eq(n,name))) rest
      	          then err COMPLAIN "clauses don't all have same function-name"
      	        else if exists (fn {pats=p,...} => length p <> patslen) rest
      	        then 
		  err COMPLAIN "clauses don't all have same number of patterns"
	        else ();
	        clauses
	      end
  	  | checkFB _ = ErrorMsg.impossible "CoreLang.checkFB"

	if calculating the length is too expensive here, 
	using the function

	fun len1 [x] = true | len1 _ = false

	will suffice, at the expense of less good error reporting.

633. space leak
Submitter: John Reppy
Date: 1/9/92
Version: 0.88
Severity: major
Problem: 
The old space leak in capture/escape seems to have reappeared.
I ran my test on versions 0.75-0.88, and here is a summary of
the results:

  version    space leak?
    75		no
    76		no
    77		yes
    78		yes
    79		yes
    80		yes
    81		no
    82		no
    83		no
    84		yes
    85		yes
    86		yes
    87		yes
    88		yes

Note that the two rounds of contract before eta were eliminated in
version 0.84.

As a reminder, the simple example of this problem is the function
select.

Code: 
  local
    open System.Unsafe.PolyCont
  in
    fun select x = capture (fn k => let
          val return = escape k
          in
            return (x ())
          end)
  end;

  which is called in the following loop:

  fun loop () = select loop
Comments: This should be constant space!
Status: fixed (again!) in 0.90

Comments:  "Uncaught exception NotDirectory" happened RANDOMLY(50%)
           when doing "val cwd = GetWorkingDirectory.getwd();
           System.Directory.cd cwd;" This is why I did ten runs
           of it in the above script. I suspect the getwd.sml
           in SourceGroup is coded in an incompatible way with 
           the version 88's Directory.cd function in perv.sml (or 
           runtime/cfuns.c), since the above bug did not occur in 87. 

           This bug occurs (sometimes,say one out of two times) when 
           making smlsg using version88.

637. Compiler bug printing signatures with polymorphic exceptions (same as 613)
Submitter: Gene Rollins
Date: 9/10/92
Version: 0.88?
Severity: minor
Problem: 
The Compiler reports a compiler bug when trying to print signatures that
contain polymorphic exceptions.  This happens with both 0.75 and 0.80 versions
on both sun4 and decstation machines running mach.
Code: 
Transcript: 
- signature SEQUENCE = sig 
   exception no_next of 'a
   end;
signature SEQUENCE = 
  sig
    exception no_next of Error: Compiler bug: domain
Comments:
If we set:
  System.Control.Print.signatures := 0;

the compiler compiles the signature fine, and does not report the compiler
bug.
[DBM:] Polymorphic exception specifications in signatures are (or should
be) illegal, so these should cause some error message.

640. flakiness of System.Env (particularly filterEnv)
Submitter: Sanjiva Prasad <sanjiva@ecrc.de>
Date: 9/16/92
Version: 0.88
Severity: major
Problem: 
Perhaps someone in your group has already discovered and fixed these bugs
in v88.  We had pulled over a copy of v88 to experiment with the new
environment features you had advertised (with the intention of trying out
an mini interpreter that does not maintain the application environment, but 
evaluates a syntax tree in a given environment). 

I mucked around a bit, trying to create some small environments by making 
type, structure, functor and value declarations, then using map, 
some list operations like rev and some auxiliary functions, and
(from System.Env) catalogEnv, topLevelEnvRef, staticPart and filterEnv.
Unfortunately, I kept getting Compiler Bug messages when I used filterEnv
(I organized my program carefully enough to isolate the occurrence of these
to the use of filterEnv).

The ugly part of the story is that although repeating the evaluation
resulted in the same bug message or exception being raised, there was
no pattern to it.  For instance, filtering out an environment from the top-level 
environment using a list of seven symbols -- obtained from applying
staticPart and then catalogEnv --  resulted in  a compiler bug message
"compstat" (I think it was that).  With a different list (again obtained
using list operations, catalogEnv, staticPart and topLevelEnvRef), I got
uncaught exception IntmapF,  and then with another list (this time built using
string-to-symbol functions in System.Symbol), I got another compiler bug
(I can't recall which).  In all cases, it is when trying to use filterEnv.

642. Sourcegroup 2.1 dependency analysis fails (see also bug 649)
Submitter:      Amy Felty, felty@research.att.com
Date:		17 Sept 92
Version:        0.90a
System:         sun4 sparc
Severity:       major

Problem:        SG2.1 compiles, but doesn't execute propery. The last
version that I know of where it works properly is 0.87. In a call to
SourceGroup.make, one of the arguments is the name of the top-level
functor (ElpSymtab in this example). It should then be able to
determine all the necessary files to compile and build the structures.
Instead, it replies with:

% structure ElpSymtab undefined

Code:           I have put a tar file in ~felty/lp-sml/SGbug.tar. It
is not very large, but contains files in several subdirectories. (It
is a very small piece of the Lambda Prolog code.)

Transcript:     I'm including a transcript of the execution in 0.90a
with the bug, followed by a transcript of the working version in 0.87.

Comments:
  This works in version 0.88.

Comments: [APT]
  I looked in and looked at this briefly.  I suspect some complication
  due to the introduction of type options in the absyn.
  The correct way to diagnose this sort of problem is:

  1) use makeml -debug0 to build a debugger version that doesn't attempt
  to execute dbguser/load.sml.

  2) execute dbguser/load.sml up to the file that causes problems.

  3) Set System.Control.debugging := true.  Under the debugger, this will

  4) Try using "dbguser/general.sml" (in this case) and look where the MARKexps

  (where the exception was raised) is expecting.

makeml: 988 Illegal instruction - core dumped
neptune 66: 

Comments: The compiler boots fine on a Sun3, so it doesn't have to be
          an MC680x0 related problem.
Comments: [Kjeld]
I have an additional comment: if -g is turned on in runtime/Makefile
(i.e. all the runtime sources are compiled with -g and without -O),
SML/NJ will boot. BUT, the compiler is flaky. It dumps a core if
large integers are evaluated, and it yields compiler bug messages
now and then in code that was compiled successfully on previous
versions.

Let me know if I can be of any help.  I'm not sure what the right
way is for debugging this.

**** From Kjeld H. Mortensen, 11/22/92, version 0.92:
I have tried to build the compiler on our HP9000s400. In order to get to
the boot point I had to make the following modifications:

-------------------------
diff cfuns.c.orig cfuns.c     (because the gethostid call isn't known)
-------------------------
30a31,33
> #ifdef HPUX
> #include <sys/utsname.h>
> #endif
1432a1436,1446
> #ifdef HPUX
>     char        buf[SNLEN+1];
>     ML_val_t    name;
>     struct utsname utsname;
>
>     uname(&utsname);
>     bcopy ((char *)(utsname.idnumber), buf, SNLEN);
>     buf[SNLEN] = '\0';  /* insure null termination */
>     name = ML_alloc_string (msp, buf);
>     RETURN(msp, name);
> #else /* !HPUX */
1442c1456
<
---
> #endif /* HPUX */

-----------------------------
diff sun2hp.el.orig sun2hp.el   (see also 564 in the masterbugs list)
-----------------------------
97,98c98
<       (goto-char point)
<       (beginning-of-line)
---
>       (goto-char (- point 2))
137a138
>   (replace-re "\\.word" "short")

The last change (converting .word to short) is new, and is thus not
mentioned
in 564.

These changes allowed me to get to the boot point (i.e. all C-sources could
be compiled). But then the compiler dumped a core. So, I have the following
bug report:

makeml: 3591 Memory fault - core dumped

Comments:
  - I have been succesful building the compiler without '-noshare', 
    but sometimes it gives a bus error when it gets to "Go for it". 

  - The version that was successfully build with 'makeml -m68 hpux8' dumps 
    a core when evaluating an integer that is too large:
        neptune 205: sml
        Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.92, November 18, 1992

        - 536870912;  (* 2^29 *)
        Illegal instruction (core dumped)

  - This is probably the same problem as in 648 (masterbugs).

  - The system builds fine on our Sun3 (also M68k) and doesn't core dump on
    large integers.

649. too strong optimization of datatype constructor (same as 642)
Submitter: Pierre Cregut
Date: 9/22/92
Version: 0.89
Severity: critical
Problem: 
  Printing simple datatype value causes "Compiler bug: constant datacon in

Code: 
  datatype dt = a of int | b of unit; (* a is necessary *)
  b ();
Transcript:

  Another version is that a piece of code is not executed
  if it is an argument of such a constructor.
  ----------------------------------------------------
  - (b (print "aa\n") ; ());
  val it = () : unit
Comment:
  That is what happened in sourcegroup.
  To make connections, sourcegroup parse the file
  The toplevel rule is of type unit so a constructor
  " interdec of unit " is associated (interdec is the
  name of the rule). 
  Because of the too strong optimization, the body
  of the rule that updates the tables by side
  effect is never executed, so source group never hears
  about the structures contained in the files it looks at.

652. Compiler bug: contmap enterv 123 building HOL

Version:        90, 91a
System:         MIPS & SPARC, UNIX
Severity:       critical
Problem:        compiler quits with Compiler bug: contmap enterv 123
Comment: [Elsa Gunter, 9/29/92]
  I spent some time last night removing the HOL code from the example.
Below is a mimimal example that causes the problem.  Along my descent
I found that the process of elimination was VERY NON-monotonic.  At
some time during the elimination process I had 
     if true then 2 else 2
which could note be replaced by 2 without the bug going away.
However, after removing some other aspects, the if_then_else was no
longer necessary.  At some point, the length of the string in the
exception being handled made a difference, but now it only matters
that there is a string.  There were other fluxuations as well.  I'm
afraid I left them on my machine at home, but if you need them, I can
try to bring them in tomorrow.
  This is very possibly not the only minimal code that causes this
bug.  I found that exceptions A and B must be different, that the one
being handled needed to take a record with at least one field having
string type and that that field had have a match against a string,
i.e., not a wild-card.
Code:
(* File: bug-652.sml *)

exception A

exception B of int*string

val _ = (raise A) handle B (_,"") => 2

(* end of file *)

Comments:
  This is a variation on bug 652.  If you unwrap the code from within
the structure then things work.  However it still bombs if the code is
all inside a structure.

Comments:
  Konrad says that the problem was in 88 as well.

Comments: [Zhong Shao, 10/6/92]
   The compiler bug: contmap enterv 123 has been there for a long long time.
   Though previously, it occurs as a compiler bug: MipsCM.select: bad dst.
   These  are caused by meaningless cps expressions such as
                 SELECT(INT 0,1,v,...) , APP(INT 0, ...)
   which are produced by the constant folding optimization on data constructors
   and exception constructors. A short but temporary fix is to let contmap.sml
   not check the validity of these expressions and let each target code 
   generator generate some code for SELECT(INT 0,1,v,...). Ideally this should
   be fixed by letting the SELECT in Lambda and CPS depend on the auxiliary 
   variable generated in each branch and switch statement, and controlling 
   the constant-folding on SELECT.

-- The problem is intermittent; the same code seems to behave

-- Strings that are entered by hand, or are built by sml processes,
such as concatenation seem not to cause the problem.  Only strings
created by execute (and input_line) seem to cause it.
-- I haven't been able to reproduce it just now, but it I recollect
that multiple executions of the same coomand (namely
System.Directory.cd src_dir; without src_dir being rebound in between)
could succeed for a while and then fail.

Comment:
	I know that several rounds of contract are done on this
	fragment, and the dead code exists after each round. For 
	some mysterious reason, code in cps/contract, that should 
	remove this, does not seem to work.

  Andrew Says:
    This is because System.Control.CG.reducemore is 15, which causes
    cpsopt to give up early when it sees diminishing returns.
    For documentation that this is a good idea, see Compiling with Continuations,
     figure 15.11, page 192.

660. signals in background sml
Submitter: 	Doug McIlroy (doug@research.att.com)
Date: 		October 22, 1992
Version: 	0.90
System: 	all
Severity: 	major for non-interactive programs

Problem: 	the inherited signal handler state of the SML process
		is getting trashed.  This means that an SML program
		running in the background still receives signals, even
		though the shell has disabled them.

Fix:		The fix will take a bit of work, since the responsibility
		for signal handling is spread throughout the system.
		We will have to make the signal handler state (enabled,
		default, ignored) more visible at the System.Signals
		level, and the top-level loop and other initialization
		code will have to check for ignored signals when setting
		the default handlers.  (JHR)

661. prettyprinter -- Compiler bug: PPTable.install_pp
Submitter:      Lal George
Date:		28 October 1992
Version:        0.91
System:         all
Severity:       minor
Problem:        install_pp incorrectly raises a compiler bug message
Code:           
	val _ = System.PrettyPrint.install_pp ["foo","bar"] Array.update
	
Transcript:

	 Error: unbound structure foo in path foo.bar
	Error: Compiler bug: PPTable.install_pp
Comments:

	The first error message is also printed with an additional 
	blank space. 
Fix:
	In file print/pptable and function install_pp, replace:
	     | _ => ErrorMsg.impossible "PPTable.install_pp"
	with
	     | _ => ErrorMsg.complain "install_pp: Malformed path"
	May as well do the same thing with fun make_path.
	[dbm] Used ErrorMsg.errorNoFile for this and make_path --
	no more calls of ErrorMsg.impossible in pptable.sml.

662. delayed interrupt on MIPS
Submitter: Dave MacQueen
Date: 10/28/92
Version: 0.91
System: MIPS/RISCOS 4.52
Severity: minor
Problem: 
  Typing the interrupt character (e.g. ^C) doesn't interrupt sml until
  after a newline is typed.
Comments:
  This could be fixed, but the piping into sml would hang under csh.
  This is really a RISCos bug.
Status: not our bug

663. gc loop on illegal character
Submitter: Lal George
Date: 10/28/92
Version: 0.91
System: SPARC, MIPS
Severity: major
Problem: 
  Typing an illegal character (e.g. ^H) at top level causes an
  infinite gc loop after the illegal character message.
Fix: [Lal George]
  The fix is to generate ml.lex.sml with a version of lexgen.sml 
  that has the latest bug fixes. The one on /usr/local/sml/bin/sparc
  does fine.

Comments:
  The "found at" part of the message is missing from the new mlyacc/base.sml

  Ok I think it fixes the problem: match thought that it could suppress its
  origin whereas it was a computed application to be done at each functor
  application. In the bogus version you could correct the problem 
  - by suppressing the signature MONOID
  - by putting an intermediate level of structure so that the optimisation
  of self was irrelevant (which is a kind of bug but we have already talked
  about it)
  (an intermediate level = functor Square(,,,) = struct structure result =
  Prod(...) end; )

677. memory leak
Submitter:      Kjeld H. Mortensen (kjeld@metasoft.com)
Date:           11/24/92
Version:        0.92
Systems:        Sparc server 330, SunOS 4.1.1,
                HP9000s400, HPUX 8.0
Severity:       Major
Problem:        Memory leaks (heap grown when not supposed to).
Code:           
Transcript:    
Comments:
I have made experiments with SML/NJ v0.92 in order to see if there were
any memory leaks. It seems to me that it is the case.

My standard experiment is the same as from bug report #500, which was fixed
by v0.82. The bug was present in v0.75 and now in v0.92, but not to the 
same degree. I've included a bug report in case you think it should be
added to the masterbugs list. 

It is very important for us that the compiler doesn't slow down over a
longer period of usage, as a result of memory leaks. So I've given the
bug a high priority.

Using the compiler over a long period of time where stuff is only evaluated
or values "overwritten", the heap size increases unnecessarely (see also
bug #500).


(v0.92)  ----------Mem Size----------    
          start      end    end-start  ratio  softmax   slow down
 Sparc   19968 kb  21096 kb  1128 kb     3      28 Mb     26 %
 HPs400  11224 kb  11900 kb   676 kb     3      32 Mb     16 %

The table shows memory usage (as show by 'ps') at the beginning and end
of the experiment, the difference between end and start, ratio and softmax
(from System.Control.Runtime), and how much slower the compiler is at
the end as compared with the beginning of the experiment. The session lasts
45 and 60 minutes for the HP and Sparc respectively.

I want to point out that the earlier version 0.82 doesn't have any
detectable memory leak and therefore no slow down.

Comments:
    Currently one must view all arguments to a functor as structures.
    In particular, if an argument to a H-O functor is itself a functor,
    it is viewed as being a functor component of a structure
    argument.  

    But suddenly here, I found some funny behaviour when trying to treat
    results of part-applying curried functors as structures.
    I've attached the session transcript.  The symptoms were repeated when
    I replayed the session script in toto.  But when I tried to
    redo things with some of the chaff (irrelevant definitions and evaluations)
    removed, things worked fine.  The Compiler bug checkList was a surprise.

690. maskSignals breaks interactive input
Submitter:      Andrew Tolmach apt@cs.pdx.edu
Date:		12/8/92
Version:        0.92
System:         Sun4 SunOS, Sequent, probably others
Severity:       minor
Problem:        maskSignals breaks interactive input
Code:          
	
- System.Signals.maskSignals true;
- ^C

Transcript:  With above code, system goes into infinite loop.
Comments:  Any signal for which a handler is installed will do in place of
	CTRL/C.  The problem is in cfuns.c/ml_wait_for_in:

  restart:; /* on EINTR */
    if (msp->inSigHandler
    || ((! _setjmp (msp->SysCallEnv)) && 
(5)	(((msp->ioWaitFlag = 1), (msp->NumPendingSigs == 0))))) {
	... 
(1)	select()
	 ...
    }
    else {
(6)	backup_kont(msp);
	sigsetmask (0);  /* re-enable signals */
	return;
    }
   
    if (sts == -1) {
	if (errno == EINTR)
(4)	    backup_kont(msp);
	else
	    raise_syserror(msp, 0);
	return;
    }

and its interaction with signal.c/sig_handler:

    /* record the signal */
(2)   msp->NumPendingSigs++;
      msp->SigTbl[ml_sig]++;

(3)   if (!msp->maskSignals) {
	if (msp->ioWaitFlag) {
	  /* We were waiting for a blocking I/O operation when the signal occurred,
	   * so longjmp out of the operation (see io_wait() in "cfuns.c"). */
	    _longjmp (msp->SysCallEnv, 1);
	}
	else ...
      }


Suppose we've called maskSignals false, setting msp->maskSignals to 
true, have called ml_wait_for_in, and are sitting in the select call 
(line 1) when a signal occurs.  The following occurs:

1) The system invokes sig_handler, which increments NumPendingSigs 
(line 2) but doesn't longjmp out because of the test at line 3.

2) The select call returns EINTR, so ml_wait_for_in calls backup_kont 
(line 4) to set up the ML state to reenter C immediately.

3) When ml_wait_for_in is reentered, it refuses to recall select because
of the test on NumPendingSignals at line 5; instead, it calls backup_kont
again (line 6), and returns to C.  This step is then repeated forever.

Fix: One possiblity is to change the test in line 5 to:

(5)	(((msp->ioWaitFlag = 1), 
	  (msp->NumPendingSigs == 0 || msp->maskSignals))))) {


Or, the position of the test against maskSignals could be changed in
sigHandler, so that the longjmp is always activated?  In that case,
EINTR should never be returned, right?

Comment [jhr]:
  I've thought about this, and I think that the correct fix is
  to check for masked signals in ml_wait_for_in (also in ml_select).
  In particular. the code should be

      if (msp->inSigHandler || msp->maskSignals || ...)

  since being in a signal handler implies masked signals.

  I would point out that calling maskSignals prior to calling
  ml_in_wait is bogus, since the whole point of ml_in_wait is
  to provide a safe place to interrupt when waiting for input.

692. signal handling on 386 can dump core
Submitter:      Andrew Tolmach apt@cs.pdx.edu
Date:		12/14/92
Version:        0.90+
System:         visible on Sequent; affects all 386 systems
Severity:       critical
Problem:        signal handling on 386 can dump core
Code:          
	
open System.Signals
fun alarmHandler(_,k) = k
val _ = setHandler(SIGALRM,SOME(alarmHandler))
open System.Timer
val setitimer = System.Unsafe.Cinterface.setitimer
fun h() = setitimer(0,TIME{sec=0,usec=10000} TIME{sec=0,usec=10000});
(* System can dump core at any time after h() is executed.
   The following sequence is quite reliable on Sequents: *)
val cd = System.Directory.cd;
fun r() = let fun f () = (cd "."; f()) in h(); f() end;
r();

Comments: 
The problem is that limitptr lives on the stack and is addressed
relative to %esp.  Unfortunately, various operations in the
386 implemention (notably saveregs, some fp operations, and
all pc-relative loads in generated code) temporarily push things onto the
stack, thus altering %esp.   But the adjust_limit routine,
which zeroes the limitptr, may be executed by command of the signal
handler *at any time* when inML == 1; thus the wrong piece of the
"ML stack frame" gets zeroed (in this case the exncont).

Fix:

Add a field MLframe to the ML state vector (for 386's only), pointing
to the base of the ML stack frame.  This field is initialized by 
restoreregs before setting inML = 1.  The signal handler uses this
pointer to access and zero the limit pointer directly, avoiding the
need for an adjust_limit routine.

[I've sent Lal a bundle containing these changes.]

Longer-term fix:

If the 386 implementation were cleaned up so that it no longer messed
with %esp, use of the MLframe pointer in the signal handler
could be replaced by scp->sp.

  If you look at the output, it seems that in the function f_fctexp,

Comments:	Don't be fooled by the fact that this code doesn't

		of cps/contract.sml.  Let me know if you want the
		original code...

Comment: [Greg, 1/18/93]
I'm not so sure that the problem is just in betaexpand, now.  The
example code I gave you compiles if you turn betaexpand off, but my
real code only compiles if you turn off all of cpsopt.

Comment: (awa)
 Compilation of his original (large) program did not infinite loop!  It merely
  kept going for approximately 14^6 beta-expansions, which took a long
  time and a lot of space.  [understatement]

Fix: [temporary. awa, 1/19/93]
  System.Control.CG.unroll := false;
  [permanent, awa, 1/20/93]
  Add "andalso n < max" to UNROLL case in body of function should_expand
  in cps/expand.sml.
  Also, let max=2, not max=5 (which was excessive)

Problem: 	System.Unsafe.SysIO.access raises an exception when its argument

Comments: 	In the long run, there should be a datatype for the return value

Comments: This is a known and "fixed" bug, but NeXTs don't know that.
Comments: [Joel Klein, 1/20/93]
I have additional information on bug report 710.  I left out which operating
system the NeXT was running.  This appears to be important, because the
"normal" NeXTs around here have a different response to the same input. Here's
the summary:

NeXT running NeXTstep 3.0:
  0.0/0.0 generates "strange float error"

NeXT running NeXTstep 2.0:
  0.0/0.0 returns 0.0

Example transscript of latter:
- 0.0/0.0;
val it = 0.0 : real
[Appel:]
SML/NJ 0.92 gives strange floating point error 0xd on NeXT 3.0.

711. SystemCall exceptions

Problem: 
I've encountered one strange behavior while playing around with SML
0.90 on a sparc.  Calls to System.system sometimes raise SystemCall
exceptions -- not in a fresh sml-sg image, but after a while, when a
few things have been compiled.

I thought it must be a problem with running out of virtual memory, but
I was able to get the same behavior after killing off several big
processes.

719. weakness zero polymorphism allowed in structures
Submitter: Andrew Wright (wright@cs.rice.edu)
Date: 1/26/93
Version: 0.93
Severity: Critical (type checking error)
Problem: 
In playing around with version 92, I noticed that the following
code type checks, assigning f the type '0Z -> '0Z.
This code is rejected by version 75.
Code: 
  structure Foo = struct
   val f = ! (ref (fn x => x))
  end
Comments:
  Is this a bug?  Or are you intending to extend SML to allow this
  structure to match the signature:

  signature FOO = sig
   val f : int -> int
  end
  [dbm] It's a bug.
Fix: change line 1014 of elaborate/elabstr.sml, replacing "isTop kind"
     with "true".

Comments: [dbm] Currently only the dynamic elements of a structure
  are printed when the structure is opened at top level.  This is a side effect
  of the fact that all dynamic components are being rebound in the toplevel
  environment.
Fix: perform special printing for open, suppressing the printing due
  to the rebinding of dynamic components.

yet if I type the following, without mutual recursion:

  - val map_test = 
  =  let fun map_list a_f [] = []
  =        | map_list a_f (x1::x2) = (a_f x1)::(map_list a_f x2)

  =  in map_test end;
  val map_test = fn : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a test -> 'b test
  - 

  it compiles ok. In this example I don't need mutual recursion but for more
  complicated ones I do. I tried to reproduce the error with the smallest example
  I could find.
Comments: [dbm]
SML doesn't allow you to use a function polymorphically in its
own (mutually) recursive definition.  It would be possible to relax
this restriction (Milner-Mycroft type system), but then typing is
undecideable (Kfoury & Tiuryn).  One could find a pragmatic way around
this that would generally work fine (CAML (Light?) does), but it
doesn't seem to be a critical need in practice, at least in our
experience.

Fix: In elaborate/elabstr.sml, locally rebind the new structure
to a special name and use this special name as the intermediary
in rebinding the components.  E.g. in the above example, the
redeclarations  produced by "open A" take the form

  local structure %str% = A
  in structure A = %str%.A
     structure B = %str%.B
  end

instead of the erroneous

  structure A = A.A
