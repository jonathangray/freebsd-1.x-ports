NAME
       foreach - Iterate over all elements in a list

SYNOPSIS
       foreach varname list body


DESCRIPTION
       In this command varname is the name of a variable, list is
       a list of values to assign to varname, and body is  a  Tcl
       script.   For  each element of list (in order from left to
       right), foreach assigns the contents of the field to  var-
       name as if the lindex command had been used to extract the
       field, then calls the Tcl  interpreter  to  execute  body.
       The  break  and  continue statements may be invoked inside
       body, with the same effect as in the for command.  Foreach
       returns an empty string.
