NAME
       seek - Change the access position for an open file

SYNOPSIS
       seek fileId offset ?origin?


DESCRIPTION
       Change  the  current  access  position for fileId.  FileId
       must have been the return value from a  previous  call  to
       open,  or  it  may be stdin, stdout, or stderr to refer to
       one of the standard I/O channels.  The offset  and  origin
       arguments  specify  the position at which the next read or
       write will occur for fileId.  Offset must  be  an  integer
       (which may be negative) and origin must be one of the fol-
       lowing:

       start  The new access position will be offset  bytes  from
              the start of the file.

       current
              The  new  access position will be offset bytes from
              the current  access  position;  a  negative  offset
              moves the access position backwards in the file.

       end    The  new  access position will be offset bytes from
              the end of the file.  A negative offset places  the
              access position before the end-of-file, and a posi-
              tive offset places the access  position  after  the
              end-of-file.

       The  origin  argument  defaults  to  start.   This command
       returns an empty string.
