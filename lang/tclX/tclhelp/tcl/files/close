NAME
       close - Close an open file

SYNOPSIS
       close fileId


DESCRIPTION
       Closes  the  file  given  by  fileId.   FileId must be the
       return value from a previous invocation of the  open  com-
       mand;  after  this command, it should not be used anymore.
       If fileId refers to a command pipeline instead of a  file,
       then close waits for the children to complete.  The normal
       result of this command is an empty string, but errors  are
       returned  if  there  are  problems  in closing the file or
       waiting for children to complete.
