NAME
       lsort - Sort the elements of a list

SYNOPSIS
       lsort ?switches? list


DESCRIPTION
       This  command  sorts the elements of list, returning a new
       list in sorted order.  By default ASCII  sorting  is  used
       with  the  result  returned in increasing order.  However,
       any of the following switches may be specified before list
       to  control  the sorting process (unique abbreviations are
       accepted):

       -ascii              Use string comparison with ASCII  col-
                           lation order.  This is the default.

       -integer            Convert  list elements to integers and
                           use integer comparison.

       -real               Convert  list  elements  to  floating-
                           point values and use floating compari-
                           son.

       -command command    Use command as a  comparison  command.
                           To  compare  two  elements, evaluate a
                           Tcl script consisting of command  with
                           the  two  elements  appended  as addi-
                           tional arguments.  The  script  should
                           return an integer less than, equal to,
                           or greater than zero if the first ele-
                           ment  is  to  be considered less than,
                           equal to, or greater than the  second,
                           respectively.

       -increasing         Sort  the  list  in  increasing  order
                           (``smallest'' items first).   This  is
                           the default.

       -decreasing         Sort  the  list  in  decreasing  order
                           (``largest'' items first).
