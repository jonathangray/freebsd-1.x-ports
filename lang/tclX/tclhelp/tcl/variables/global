NAME
       global - Access global variables

SYNOPSIS
       global varname ?varname ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This  command  is  ignored unless a Tcl procedure is being
       interpreted.  If so then it declares the  given  varname's
       to  be  global  variables rather than local ones.  For the
       duration of the current procedure (and only while  execut-
       ing in the current procedure), any reference to any of the
       varnames will refer to the global  variable  by  the  same
       name.
