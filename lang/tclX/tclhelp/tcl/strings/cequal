       cequal string1 string2
              This  command  compares  two  strings for equality.
              Returns 1 if string1 and string2 are the  identical
              and 0 if they are not.  This command is a short-cut
              for string compare and  avoids  the  problems  with
              string expressions being treated unintentionally as
              numbers.

              This command is provided by Extended Tcl.
