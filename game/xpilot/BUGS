<BUG>	001
<STATUS>open/low
<VER>	2.0
<DESC>	kenrsc
	The ball-string has doesn't take heavy tension, it produces wild,
	lethal occilations.
<WORK>	kenrsc
	What to do we do with this one. My suggestion is to drop
	the ball when the string stretches too far. What is yours?
<WORK>  930919: bert
	I don't see this bug as a problem.  When manouvring the ball
	the player should take care not to have it oscillate too strong
	or the player should find a way to reduce to oscillations.
	But I may not have seen the effect this bug refers too.

<BUG>	002
<STATUS>open/low
<VER>	2.0
<DESC>	bjoerns
	Ball should be affected by object collisions. 

<BUG>	003
<STATUS>deferred/low
<VER>	1.2
<DESC>	unknown
	Players can fly through walls at high speed, this isn't the case for
	objects (they use different collision detection methods).

<BUG>	004
<STATUS>open/low
<VER>	3.0.4
<DESC>	930900: kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no
	Limited lives.  New human players are dead when entering a game
	where somebody has lost a life. This is not true for robots.
<WORK>  930915 kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no
	Bert did you not change it so that if robots where left in the game
	it would start over again ? If so, does it do anything harm having
	the robots entering. Lowered the status to low since robots wont
	join in to often.
<WORK>  930919: bert
	I don't expect that adding more robots will be a problem.
	If only robots are alive then they have won the game and the
	game resets.

<BUG>	005
<STATUS>open/low
<VER>	2.0
<DESC>	930900: kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no
    	The treasure is not correct. Sometimes the ball disapears for
	good.  There are also other things, but I don't remember now.

<BUG>	006
<STATUS>fixed/low
<VER>	3.0.4
<DESC>	930910: kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no
	Mychar for robots 'R' disapears when robots has been dead in
	limited lives.
<WORK>	930911: bert@mc.bio.uva.nl
	Fixed it I hope.

<BUG>	007
<STATUS>fixed/medium
<VER>	3.0.3
<DESC>	930909: alt.games.xpilot
	If you release too many tanks at once the server hangs.
<WORK>  930919: bert
	Couldn't reproduce it.  My experiment was to see if it had
	anything to do with not having enough bases.  I don't know if
	tanks need bases at all.
<DESC>	931001: Derek C. Richardson (dcr@mail.ast.cam.ac.uk)
	Had that tank bug again yesterday: swa launched two tanks directly
	in my face and the server froze with the message:
	   Write socket buffer not big enough (4096,4085,"%c%c%c")
	Has any progress been made with this problem? Has anyone else HAD the
	problem? (we're running SunOS 4.1.x on Sparc IPX's and 10's here).
	Also with tanks: when they're launched they show up in the player list,
	with an amazing negative score (-500 or so). What happens if all the
	bases are occupied so that there is actually no more room for players?
	(this was the case last night). Could this be the origin of the problem?
<WORK>  931001: bert
	Made some small fixes which hopefully solve this problem.
	Tanks weren't properly excluded from certain player calculations.
	Tanks don't need (and didn't use) bases, but this wasn't properly
	reckoned with at all places.
	Clients shouldn't get homebase info for tanks.

<BUG>	008
<STATUS>open/low
<VER>	3.0.3
<DESC>	930912: chc@dale.ksc.nasa.gov (Charles Curley)
	Has anyone else noticed that on when you get near the edge of a
	wrapped map that you can't shoot when you nose is within say 20
	pixels of the edge?
<WORK>	930912: bert
	The problem is that when the center of a player is close to the edge
	then the expression "shot->pos = pl->pos + ships[dir].pts[0]" may
	result in a value bigger than the mapwidth/height.

<BUG>	009
<STATUS>open/low
<VER> 	3.0.4
<DESC>	930920:	kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no (Ken Ronny Schouten)
	If a player hit a mine you have placed somewhere the point of that
	mine will show up on the position you are now. This is wrong. It 
	should only show up on your hud.

<BUG> 	010
<STATUS>fixed
<VER>	3.0.4
<DESC>	930923: kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no (Ken Ronny Schouten)
	If you iconify your window during limited lives it does not always
	pop up again. I think this has something to do with the locking on
	different people. I have never experienced this bug when not locking
	on someone during a game.
<WORK>  930928: kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no (Ken Ronny Schouten)
        Fixed it I hope :) The status field for the player that was sent over
        was for the player you where locked on when you where dead and not
	the status field for yourself. Changed this and now it seems to work
	just fine.

<BUG> 	011
<STATUS>open/medium
<VER>	3.0.4
<DESC>	930930: Charles Curley (chc@dale.ksc.nasa.gov)
	Cloaks don't seem to work sometimes.  Mostly with three of more
	people we will have a situation where some players can see
	others all the time regardless of the others cloak situation.
	eric@soda.berkeley.edu (Eric van Bezooijen):
	We here have also noticed the cloak problem.  We are running
	everything on Solaris 2.x on Sparc-boxes.  It is quite rare,
	however.  It is just like he describes.  Once in a while there
	will be a player playing who I can always see, regardless whether
	or not he has cloaking or not, with dashed lines around his ship...
<WORK>	931001: bert
	Had a thorough look at all of the visibility code and made
	a possible fix.  The updateVisibility flag is now explicitly set
	when a player reenters the game.  It appeared that the lastChange
	flags in the player visibility structure were nowhere initialised.
<DESC>	931007: Jonathan Katz (jonathan@cad.ucla.edu)
	There seems to be a bug in the current release (3.0.5)
	and the last couple) that allows usually a pair of people
	on our server to be unable to cloak from each other.
	The cloaked individual will be 'ghosted' but visible....
	Also they will show up on the world map and radar...
<DESC>	931011:  Gary O'Brien <gary@hpmtlgo.lvld.hp.com>
	We're using xpillot 3.0.5 on HP 700 series.  We still have the
	cloak bug problem.  We see the problem if there are more than
	2 human players in the game.  The general rule is if your cloaked
	and can see them, then they can see you.  A player which is cloaked
	and not visible cannoot seee you either.


<BUG> 	012
<STATUS>fixed/low
<VER>	3.0.4
<DESC>	931001: Derek C. Richardson (dcr@mail.ast.cam.ac.uk)
	Have you noticed that you can shoot your own tank down and get
	points for it? Nice way to bump up your sccore ((this practice
	is frowned upon here of course).
<WORK>	931001: bert
	This was true for maps without player shielding (noshields)
	were tanks didn't have shields either.  Changed it to have
	tanks three seconds of shields after they are released.
	This makes it difficult to shoot your own tank.
	The OBJ_SHIELD flag was set in the status field instead
	of the used field.  Ouch!
<WORK>	931116: bert
	The issue that remains is that a detached tank has very little
	fuel, so it can still be shot down easily if the player is
	persistent enough.  Dunno if we should care about that.
	Being able to cheat is something I tend to like in a nice game :-)

<BUG> 	013
<STATUS>fixed/high
<VER>	3.0.4
<DESC>	931004: snil@daimi.aau.dk (Sven Nielsen)
	This Zombie BUG can be quite annoying! One evening I was playing
	tournament on a norweigean server when it happened to Data. After I
	had quit he was still in the game. I later came back (had to invent
	the name Ups!) and saw that Zombie Mr. Data was really spoiling the
	game. It didn't take long for the other players to find out that Data
	and Ups!  where from the same host and I got accused of
	cheating/ruining the game on purpose. I tried different things to
	get my Zombie out but that was impossible. The owner of the server
	process was not logged on so no-one had permission to kick him.
	This BUG can be pretty annoying.
	I don't know too much about the UDP protocol, but I imagine, that if
	the packet containing QUIT! is lost then a thing like that may happen.
	How about inventing an acknowledgement scheme or a way to kick your
	*own* pilots ???
<WORK>	931004: bert
	The client/server protocol had a mechanism to automatically kick
	players out of the game if they didn't respond for about 40 seconds.
	I don't understand why this isn't working anymore (it used to work!).
<WORK>	911116: bert
	Fixed.  It was one of the most important fixes in 3.0.6.

<BUG> 	014
<STATUS>open/low
<VER>	3.0.5
<DESC>	931005: Mark Boyns
	I have a problem with robot's Ids disappearing.  Sometimes I will see
	a robot flying around without a name.  The problem seems to be sort
	of random, and I have not spent any time trying to figure out why.

<BUG> 	015
<STATUS>fixed/low
<VER>	3.0.5
<DESC>	931020: pery@hprnd.rose.hp.com (Pery Pearson)
	I usually leave the xpilot server up for as long as it will stay up
	(it tends to crash after a day or two 8).  I just pause when not
	playing.  Sometimes my fuel will be depleted when I return even if I
	had a full tank when I paused.
<WORK>	931020: bert
	It could be the case that at some places in the code
	a check for the player being paused is missing.
<WORK>	931021: Mr M J Cleaton
	The solution is simple - deactivate your shields before pausing.
<WORK>	931116: bert
	If I remember correctly this has been fixed in 3.0.6.

<BUG>	016
<STATUS>open/low
<VER>	3.0.6
<DESC>	931110: kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no (Ken Ronny Schouten)
	If you play in limited lives mode and commit suicide you will lose
	a life but it will not show on the score list. I.e. if you commit
	suicide once when you have 3 lives the score list will tell you 3
	but you have only 2.

<BUG>	017
<STATUS>open/medium
<VER>	3.0.6
<DESC>	931125: bert
	There is a problem with the client getting corrupted frame updates.
	In a frame update the `loops' variable is printed twice.
	Once at the start of the frame and another time at the end of the
	frame.  The problem is that the client prints that the first value
	differs from the second value and therefore that the frame is
	corrupted and ignored.
	The second value is always the corrupted one.
	I would like to know if this is due to a bug in the sound packet
	code or not.  I.e., does a non-sound client experience this only
	with sound-packet-sending servers or with all servers.
	The sound packets are printed at the end of the frame, therefore
	that might (?) be a possible cause of this problem.

<BUG>	018
<STATUS>open/medium
<VER>	3.0.6
<DESC>	931210: ferhati@aremihp.univ-lille1.fr (Ramdane FERHATI)
	In the maps where there are no team bases, and you specify
	team play, nobody can join the server.
	I propose that the server randomly choses a team number for
	each non-team home base when in team mode.
<WORK>	931210: bjoerns
	At least, the server should warn about this condition.
