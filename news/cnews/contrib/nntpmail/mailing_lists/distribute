#
# Distribute stdin (presumed to be a digest or direct-mail article from
# a mailing list) according to the following flags
#
# -n newsgroup		post article to specified newsgroup.
# -a file		append to the file specified.
# -m people		remail to people, people may be a filename
#			in which case the contents will be assumed
#			to be a list of recipients, one to a line.
#			note that in the case of a file all recipients
#			will appear on the headers, and therefore
#			an alias is best used for large lists.
# -d directory		store into a file named by volume and
#			issue under "directory".  Useful for digests.
# -am name		shorthand for '-a name -m /local/share/mail/lists/name'
# -dm name		shorthand for '-d name -m /local/share/mail/lists/name'
#
# Notes:
# - When using -a or -m alone, a full path is required, which does differ
#   with what -am and -dm expect (the name of the mailing list only).
# - If invoked from sendmail, all arguments will be lowercase only!
