.Ch "News Flow"

.PP
The flow of news articles through C news is as follows:
a batch is received by some network service and passed to
.I rnews ,
.Ix rnews
which invokes
.I $NEWSBIN/input/newsspool
.Ix newsspool
to queue the batch in
.B $NEWSARTS/in.coming ;
.Ix in.coming
.Ix files in.coming
eventually
.I $NEWSBIN/input/newsrun
.Ix newsrun
will be run by
.I cron ,
.Ix cron
.I newsrun
uncompresses any files in
.B in.coming
and
either hands the batch to
.I $NEWBIN/relay/relaynews
.Ix relaynews
locally or invokes
.I relaynews
over a network connection on its file server.
.PP
.I relaynews
writes the name of each spool file onto the ends of batch files
for neighbours.
Eventually
.I cron
runs
.I $NEWSBIN/batch/sendbatches ,
.Ix sendbatches
which
batches up the outgoing articles and transmits them over some network.
