.SH NAME
Rnmail - a program for replying via mail
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Rnmail destination_list
.br
  or
.br
.B Rnmail -h headerfile [oldarticle]
.br
  or
.br
.B Rnmail
.SH DESCRIPTION
Rnmail is a friendly interface for mailing replies to news articles.
It will ask several questions, then allow you to enter your letter,
and then mail it off.
If you type h and a carriage return at any point,
.I Rnmail
will tell you what it wants to know.
.PP
If you put a
.I .signature
file in your home directory, Rnmail will append it
to your message after you are done editing it.
If you prefer to see your signature while you are editing, rename your
\&.signature file to be .mail_sig and it will be appended before you
begin to edit.
Note that both .mail_sig and .signature obey the setting of DOTDIR unless
Rnmail was modified to take the .signature appending out of Rnmail's control
and that if both files exist you get two signatures appended.
.PP
The -h form is used when invoked from
.I trn
or
.IR rn .
If your editor can edit multiple files, and you want the article to which
you are replying to show up as an alternate file, define the environment
variable MAILPOSTER as \*(L"Rnmail -h %h %A\*(R".
You can also modify the the MAILHEADER environment variable to change the
header file that
.I [t]rn
passes to Rnmail.
