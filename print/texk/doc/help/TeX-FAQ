Comp.text.tex is a forum for the discussion of TeX, LaTeX and other
related things. TeX is a software system written by Donald Knuth to
typeset text, especially text containing mathematics. LaTeX is a set
of macros written in TeX, designed to simplify the the typesetting of
a document by allowing the user to concentrate on the content and
structure of the document rather than the exact appearance of the
finished product. METAFONT, also discussed here, is a program which
allows the user to design their own fonts. The definitive reference
for TeX is _The TeXbook_, by Donald Knuth (Addison Wesley, 1984, ISBN
0-201-13447-0, paperback 0-201-13448-9). For LaTeX, see _LaTeX, a
Document Preparation System_ by Leslie Lamport (Addison Wesley, 1986,
ISBN 0-201-15790-X). For METAFONT, see _The METAFONTbook_ by Donald
Knuth (Addison Wesley, 1984, ISBN 0-201-13445-4). The American
Mathematical Society has two macro packages which are also popular,
called AMS-TeX and AMS-LaTeX.

This article contains answers to some frequently asked questions on
comp.text.tex. Please don't ask these questions again, as they've been
answered many times before. Note that Guoying Chen
(chenguo@spunky.cs.nyu.edu) posts the monthly document ``Supplementary 
TeX Information'' to this newsgroup containing other information and 
software relevant to TeX users but beyond the scope of this article.

If you are looking, for instance, for the answer to question 17, and wish
to skip everything else, you can search ahead for the regular expression
``^17)''.

These are all legitimate questions, but they seem to appear too 
frequently for long-time readers of the list. 

Many of the answers below tell you that you can obtain something
through anonymous ftp. ``Ftp'' stands for file transfer protocol, and
is also the name of a program implementing the protocol. The program
allows users to transfer files to and from remote sites, if the sites
are connected via a network such as the Internet. ``Anonymous ftp'' 
indicates a user may connect to a remote site as the user 
``anonymous'' with a password consisting of their email address, and
thus be able to retrieve files from that site. Remember, anonymous
ftp is a privilege and the system administrators for these sites 
have made these files available out of their own generosity. Therefore
please restrict your ftp'ing to non-prime hours at the various sites.

I would like to acknowledge Don Hosek, Ken Yap, Tomas Rokicki, and
Micah Beck, whose postings provided many of the answers. Joe Weening,
Hal Perkins, Walter Carlip, Max Hailpern, Tad Guy, Raymond Chen,
Henning Schulzrinne, Sebastian Rahtz, Mark James, Peter Galko, Mike
Ernst, Rainer Sch\"opf, Oren Patashnik, Philippe Louarn, Rafal
Zbikowski, Anita Marie Hoover, David Rhead, Darrell McCauley, Cameron
Smith, Emma Pease, Patrick McPhee, Karl Berry, Robin Fairbairns, and
Joohee Jeong provided additional material and criticisms. The format
of this document is based on the Frequently Asked Questions written by
Steve Hayman which formerly appeared in comp.unix.wizards. Any
mistakes are mine. Send corrections, suggestions, and additions to
bobby@hot.caltech.edu.

1) How can I get a copy of this article?

   You're reading it aren't you? SAVE it :-). This article is posted
   monthly to comp.text.tex and cross-posted to news.answers. It is
   therefore archived at any site that archives news.answers.
   News.answers is archived on rtfm.mit.edu (18.70.0.209), and this
   article is available there via anonymous ftp in the directory
   ./pub/usenet/news.answers/tex-faq. If you do not have anonymous
   ftp, send an e-mail message containing the lines ``SENDME FAQ.'' to
   fileserv@shsu.edu (fileserv@shsu.bitnet).  Another way to retrieve
   it via email is through the mailserver at rtfm: send a message
   containing the lines ``help'' and ``index'' to
   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu for information on how to obtain it.
 
   Other news.answers/FAQ archives are: cnam.cnam.fr (163.173.128.6)
   in the anonymous ftp directory /pub/FAQ; ftp.uu.net (192.48.96.2)
   in the anonymous ftp directory /pub/usenet (also available via mail
   server requests to netlib@uunet.uu.net, or via uunet's 1-900
   anonymous UUCP phone number); and ftp.cs.ruu.nl (131.211.80.17) in
   the anonymous ftp directory NEWS.ANSWERS (also accessible via mail
   server requests to mail-server@cs.ruu.nl). Many of the archives
   mentioned in question 22 also maintain current versions of this
   document.

2) Where can I get a DVI to PostScript conversion program?

   Two good DVI to PostScript conversion programs that run under
   Unix are:
     dvips - by Tomas Rokicki. This driver is very nice and has the
       ability to deal with virtual fonts. Available via anonymous ftp
       from labrea.stanford.edu (36.8.0.112) in ./pub. Dvips is
       written in C and ports easily to other operating systems.  It
       is available for VMS via anonymous ftp from any CTAN site (see
       question 22) and also through the DECUS library (see question
       22). A precompiled version for MSDOS is available from
       monu1.cc.monash.edu.au (130.194.1.101) in ./pub/dvips54.zip or
       from shape.mps.ohio-state.edu (128.146.110.30) in
       ./pub/msdos/dvips/dvips54.zip. If you wish to use postscript
       fonts, get dvipslib.zip as well.  Documentation is available in
       dvips.ps.Z. Karl Berry has a version of dvips called dvipsk
       which has a configure script and path searching code similar to
       that in his other programs (e.g., web2c).  It is available via
       anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.umb.edu (158.121.104.33) in
       ./pub/tex/.

     dvitops - by James Clark. Available via anonymous ftp from any CTAN site
       (see question 22, e.g., pip.shsu.edu (192.92.115.10)), in 
       ./tex-archive/dviware/dvitops. Dvitops is written in C and will 
       compile under Unix, MSDOS, VMS, and Primos.

3) How can I include a PostScript figure in LaTeX?

   Perhaps the best way to do this is to use the psfig macros written
   by Trevor Darrell. They are available via anonymous ftp from
   whitechapel.media.mit.edu (18.85.0.125) in ./pub/psfig. You will
   also need a dvi to PostScript conversion program that supports
   \specials. The ones mentioned in question 2 do, and come with a
   version of psfig ready to use with them. The psfig macros work best
   with Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPS). In particular, psfig will
   need the file to have a BoundingBox (see Appendix C of the
   _PostScript Language Reference Manual_). If you don't have an EPS
   file, life can be difficult.

   One further note about including PostScript figures is that they
   are not part of the dvi file, but are included when you use a dvi
   to PostScript conversion program. As a result, most dvi previewers
   will simply show the blank space TeX has reserved for your figure,
   not the figure itself.

   Anil K. Goel has written a long document describing in detail how to
   include figures, pictures, and images in LaTeX documents. It is available
   via anonymous ftp from math.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.140.144) in
   ./pub/figsInLatex.ps.Z. A dvi file with the included PostScript files
   is also available.

4) Where can I find a DVI previewer for machine Y running Q?

   This briefly lists some previewers available via anonymous ftp. All
   are available from any CTAN site (see question 22) in addition to the
   sites listed below:
      dvipage - For SunView. This was published in volume 15 of 
        comp.sources.unix and is available at sites that archive
        this. One such source is archive.cis.ohio-state.edu 
        (128.146.8.52).
      xtex - For the X Window System. Available via anonymous ftp 
        from ftp.cs.colorado.edu (128.138.243.151) in 
        ./pub/cs/misc/SeeTeX/SeeTeX/SeeTeX-*.tar.Z.
      dviapollo- for Apollo Domain. Available via anonymous ftp from
        labrea.stanford.edu (36.8.0.112) in ./pub/dviapollo.tar.Z.
      dvidis - For VAXstation VWS. Available via anonymous ftp from
        src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1) in /packages/tex/dviware/dvidis.
      xdvi - Also for the X Window System. Available via anonymous ftp
        from ftp.x.org (192.112.44.100) in ./contrib/xdvi.tar.Z. Karl
        Berry has a version of called xdvik with features analogous
        to his dvipsk (see question 2) available via anonymous ftp from
        ftp.cs.umb.edu (158.121.104.33) in ./pub/tex.
      dvitovdu - for Tektronix 4010 and other terminals under Unix.
        Available via anonymous ftp from wsmr-simtel20.army.mil
        (192.88.110.20) in the directory pd6:<unix-c.printers> as
        dvi2vdu.tar-z (ftp in ``tenex'' mode).
      dvi2tty - A dvi to ASCII conversion program, for normal terminals.
        Available from ftp.cs.ruu.nl (131.211.80.17) in 
        ./pub/TEX/DVI/dvi2tty.shar. A VMS version is available from
        fileserv@shsu.edu (see question 22).
      texsgi - For SGI under Irix. Available via anonymous ftp from 
        ftp.brl.mil (128.63.16.158) in ./info-iris/tex. Both a binary 
        and source are available, but be sure to get the fonts as well.
   
5) Where can I get the manual for PiCTeX?

   The PiCTeX manual is not free. It is available for $30 ($35 with the
   disk) from the TeX Users Group:
                     TeX Users Group
                     P. O. Box 869
                     Santa Barbara, CA 93102-0869 (USA)
                     805-963-1338
                     FAX: 805-963-8358
                     tug@tug.org

   The proceeds from this sale go to Michael Wichura, the author of PiCTeX,
   and TUG.

6) What is VorTeX and where can I get it?

   VorTeX is a package of programs written at the University of California.
   It includes several nice previewers and some Emacs modes for TeX and
   BibTeX. It is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu
   (128.32.149.78) in ./ucb/mhgs. The VorTeX distribution is not maintained.

7) What is OzTeX and where can I get it (TeX for the Mac)?

   OzTeX is a public domain version of TeX for the Macintosh. A DVI
   Previewer and PostScript driver are also included. It should run on
   any Macintosh Plus, SE, II, or newer model, but will not work on a
   128K or 512K Mac. It was written by Andrew Trevorrow, and is available 
   via anonymous ftp from from midway.uchicago.edu (128.135.12.73) in 
   ./pub/OzTeX, which contains other public domain TeX-related software 
   for the Mac as well, or on a floppy disk from TUG (see question 11). 
   Questions about OzTeX may be directed to oztex@midway.uchicago.edu.
   
8) What is Fig and where can I get it?

   Fig is a menu driven tool similar to MacDraw that allows you to
   draw objects on the screen of a Sun Workstation running SunView.
   TransFig is a set of tools which translate the code fig produces to
   other graphics languages including PostScript and the LaTeX picture
   environment. Both are available via anonymous ftp from
   ftp.cs.cornell.edu (128.84.218.75) in ./pub/fig. Both Fig and
   TransFig are also available from the Clarkson archive server at
   sun.soe.clarkson.edu (see question 22). Fig is supported by Micah
   Beck (beck@cs.cornell.edu) and Transfig is maintained by Brian
   Smith (bvsmith@lbl.gov). Another tool for fig conversion is fig2MF
   which generates METAFONT code from fig input. It is available from
   the CTAN archives discussed in question 22.

   XFig is essentially the same program except it runs under the X
   Window System. It is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.x.org
   (192.112.44.100) in ./contrib/R5fixes/xfig-patches/xfig-2.1.*.Z. It
   was written by Brian Smith.

9) How do I get WEB for C, FORTRAN, or some other language?

   There is a version of WEB for C called CWEB written by Silvio Levy. It
   is available via anonymous ftp from princeton.edu (128.112.128.1) in 
   the directory ./pub/cweb.

   There is a version of WEB called Spidery WEB which supports many 
   languages including ADA, awk, and C. It was written by Norman Ramsey 
   and, while not in the public domain, is usable free. It is available 
   via anonymous ftp from pip.shsu.edu (192.92.115.10) in 
   tex-archive/web/spiderweb.

   FWEB is a version of WEB for Fortran, Ratfor, and C written by John
   Krommes (krommes@lyman.pppl.gov). Version 1.13 is available via
   anonymous ftp from lyman.pppl.gov (192.55.106.129) in ./pub/fweb.

   SchemeWEB is a Unix filter that translates SchemeWEB into LaTeX source
   or Scheme source. It was written by John Ramsdell and is available from
   sun.soe.clarkson.edu (128.153.12.3) in ./pub/tex/tex-programs/schemeweb.

   APLWEB is a version of WEB for APL and is available from
   watserv1.waterloo.edu (129.97.129.140) in ./languages/apl.

   FunnelWeb is a version of WEB that is language independent. It is 
   available via anonymous ftp from ftp.adelaide.edu.au (129.127.40.3)
   in ./pub/funnelweb. It also appeared in comp.sources.unix volume 26
   issue 121, posted 11 April 1993. Another language independent version
   of WEB is NUWEB, available via anonymous ftp from cs.rice.edu
   (128.42.1.30) in ./public/preston. NUWEB is written in ANSI C.

   Most of the above are also available from your nearest CTAN site
   (see question 22).

10) How can I typeset music in TeX?

    A package called MuTeX, written by Andrea Steinbach and Angelika
    Schofer, aids in doing this. It is available via anonymous ftp
    from ftp.cs.ruu.nl (131.211.80.17) in pub/TEX/MuTeX.tar.Z.  This
    package allows you to typeset single-staff music and lyrics.

    A more powerful package which allows the typesetting of orchestral
    and polyphonic music is MusicTeX, written by Daniel Taupin 
    (taupin@frups51.bitnet). It is available via anonymous ftp from
    rsovax.ups.circe.fr (130.84.128.100) [.musictex]. It should also
    be available from the archive sites detailed in question 22.

    There is a mailing list for discussion of typesetting music in TeX.
    To subscribe, send a request to mutex-request@stolaf.edu.

11) What is TUG and TUGboat?

    TUG is the TeX Users Group. TUGboat is their newsletter, containing
    useful articles about TeX and METAFONT. TUG also distributes
    TeX-related microcomputer software on disks. Inquiries should be 
    directed to:
                     TeX Users Group
                     P. O. Box 869
                     Santa Barbara, CA 93102-0869 (USA)
                     805-963-1338
                     FAX: 805-963-8358
                     tug@tug.org

12) How do I convert Adobe's afm files to tfm format?

    Use the afm2tfm program distributed with dvips, available via
    anonymous ftp from labrea.stanford.edu (36.8.0.112) in ./pub. 

    For the Macintosh, there is a program called EdMetrics which does
    the job (and more). It is available free from:
              Blue Sky Research
              534 Southwest Third Avenue
              Portland, Oregon 97204 (USA)
              800-622-8398 or 503-222-9571

13) In LaTeX, how do I get a double-spaced document?

    Are you producing a thesis, and trying to obey regulations that were
    drafted in the typewriter era?  LaTeX is a typesetting system, so the
    appropriate design conventions are for ``real books''.  Find whoever
    is responsible for the regulations, and try to get the wording changed
    to cater for typeset theses (e.g., to say ``if using a typesetting 
    system, aim to make your thesis look like a well-designed book'').

    If you fail to convince your officials, or want some inter-line 
    space for copy-editing:
     - Try changing \baselinestretch: \renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.2}
       may be enough to give officials the impression you've kept
       to their regulations.  Don't try changing \baselineskip: its
       value is reset at any size-changing command.
     - Alternatively, get doublespace.sty from any CTAN site (see question 22,
       e.g., pip.shsu.edu (192.92.115.10)) in 
       ./tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc. There's also a setspace.sty
       in the same directory which is more flexible, and consistent with the
       latest release of LaTeX.

    It's not worth going to a lot of trouble.  (If officials won't allow
    standard typographic conventions, you won't be able to produce an
    aesthetically pleasing document anyway!)

14) In LaTeX, how do I include a file in the verbatim environment?

    A good way to do this is to use Rainer Sch\"opf's verbatim.sty,
    which provides the command \verbatiminput that takes a file
    as an argument. This package is available from any CTAN site (see 
    question 22) in ./tex-archive/macros/latex/distribs. Several
    files are needed.

    Another way to do this is to use the alltt environment defined in
    the style file alltt.sty available from the CTAN archives in 
    ./tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/alltt.sty.

15) In LaTeX, how do I do Y?

    If you can't figure out how to do something in LaTeX after you
    have read the manual very carefully, asked your local LaTeX
    guru, and thought about it, there is a LaTeX help service 
    available. Please note that the way to accomplish something 
    in LaTeX is often by using an appropriate style file, so please
    check this also (see question 16). If none of this works, send mail 
    in English describing your problem to latex-help@cs.stanford.edu. 
    If you haven't gotten a reply to your problem within about a week, 
    send mail to latex-help-coordinator@cs.stanford.edu.

16) Where can I find a TeX macro or LaTeX style file for doing Y?

    Before you ask for a TeX macro or LaTeX style file to do something, 
    please search the TeX macro index written by David M. Jones
    (dmjones@theory.lcs.mit.edu) and available via anonymous ftp
    from theory.lcs.mit.edu (18.52.0.92) in ./pub/tex/TeX-index. Those 
    without access to anonymous ftp can send a message containing the
    line ``send tex TeX-index'' to archive-server@theory.lcs.mit.edu.
    The index is an excellent reference document with plenty of 
    cross-references. Also, many of the archive sites mentioned in
    question 22 maintain extensive latex style collections, which you
    can look through if you need something not in the index.
    
17) How do I generate an index in TeX/LaTeX?

    Making an index is not trivial. There are several indexing programs
    which aid in doing this. The following are available from any CTAN
    site (see question 22):
      makeindex - for LaTeX under Unix (but runs under other OS's
         without changes). A version for the Macintosh is available from
         Johnny Tolliver at tolliver%atf.mfenet@nmfecc.llnl.gov. The 
         Makeindex documentation is a good source of information on how 
         to create your own index. Makeindex can be used with some TeX macro
         packages other than LaTeX, such as Eplain.
      idxtex - for LaTeX under VMS.
      texix - for TeX on CMS and Macintosh machines.
      texindex - for LaTeX under Unix. Available from
         comp.sources.misc archives in Volume 23.

18) How do I get METAFONT to do what I want it to do?

    METAFONT allows you to create your own fonts, and ordinary TeX users
    will never need to use it. METAFONT, unlike TeX, requires some 
    customization. Each output device for which you will be generating 
    fonts needs a mode associated with it. Modes are defined using the 
    mode_def convention described on page 94 of _The METAFONTbook_. So 
    first create a file, which we will call local.mf, containing all the 
    mode_defs you will be using. The file modes.mf by Karl Berry,
    available via anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.umb.edu (158.121.104.33) in
    ./pub/tex is a good starting point for this. Listings of settings for 
    various output devices are also published periodically in TUGboat 
    (see question 11). Now create a plain base file using inimf, plain.mf, 
    and local.mf:
       % inimf
       This is METAFONT....
       **plain                 # you type plain
       (output)
       *input local            # you type this
       (output)
       *dump                   # you type this
       Beginning to dump on file plain....
       (output)
       %
    This should create a base file named plain.base (or something close)
    and should be moved to the directory containing the base files on
    your system.
 
    Now you need to make sure METAFONT loads this base when it starts
    up. If METAFONT loads the plain base by default on your system, then
    you're ready to go. Under Unix, we might, for instance define a 
    command mf which executes ``virmf &plain,'' loading the plain base
    file.
 
    The usual way to create a font with plain METAFONT is to then start 
    it with the line
       \mode=<mode name>; mag=<magnification>; input <font file name>
    in response to the * prompt or on the METAFONT command line. If 
    <mode name> is unknown or omitted, then the mode defaults to proof 
    mode. If this has happened METAFONT will produce an output file
    called <font file name>.2602gf. The <magnification> is a floating 
    point number or magstep (magsteps are defined in _The METAFONTbook_ 
    and _The TeXbook_). If mag=<magnification> is omitted, then the 
    default is 1. For example, to generate cmr10 at 12pt for an epson 
    printer you would type
       mf \mode=epson; mag=1.2; input cmr10
    Note that under Unix the '\' and ';' characters must usually be 
    escaped, so this would typically look something like
       mf \\mode=epson\; mag=1.2\; input cmr10
 
    If you don't have inimf or need a special mode that isn't in the
    base, you can put its commands in a file (e.g., ln03.mf) and invoke
    it on the fly with the \smode command. For example, to create 
    ln03.300gf for an LN03 printer, using the file
	% This is ln03.mf as of 2/27/90
	% mode_def courtesy of John Sauter
	proofing:=0;
	fontmaking:=1;
	tracingtitles:=0;
	pixels_per_inch:=300;
	blacker:=0.65;
	fillin:=-0.1;
	o_correction:=.5;
    (note the absence of the mode_def and enddef commands), you would type
       mf \smode="ln03"; input cmr10
    
19) Where do I get TeX/LaTeX for machine Y running Q?

    Unix - The Unix TeX distribution is available via anonymous ftp from any 
       CTAN archive (see question 22). If you don't want to do this, you can 
       order it from the University of Washington, for a small fee. Contact:
                  Director
                  Northwest Computing Support Center
                  Thomson Hall, Mail Stop DR-10
                  University of Washington
                  Seattle, WA 98195 (USA)
                  (206)543-6259
       or send electronic mail to Elizabeth Tachikawa at 
       elisabet@max.u.washington.edu (note the ``s''). The fee charged 
       for getting the TeX distribution through the University of 
       Washington helps fund the further development of Unix TeX, so 
       it's a good idea to order it this way.

       Instructions for retrieving TeX via anonymous ftp are available
       in the document FTP.nwc, itself available via anonymous ftp from
       ftp.cs.umb.edu (158.21.104.33) in ./pub/tex.

       Note: The Unix version of TeX allows your ``macros'' or ``inputs''
       and ``fonts'' directories to be hierarchically organized with
       further subdirectories, rather than dumping everything into one
       directory. This can cause TeX to start very slowly. The cure
       for this problem is to insure each subdirectory contains either
       only directories or only files.

    AIX - TeX for the IBM RS6000 running AIX can be found on
       ftp.uni-stuttgart.de (129.69.8.13) in
       ./tex-archive/systems/unix/aix3.1.

    386/ix - Executables for the 386/ix are available via anonymous ftp 
       from tik.vtt.fi (130.188.52.2) in ./pub/tex/bin-386ix and from 
       math.berkeley.edu (128.32.183.94) in ./pub/tex386ix.tar.Z.

    PC - A TeX package for the PC, including LaTeX, BibTeX, previewers,
       and drivers is available via anonymous ftp from 
       vax.eedsp.gatech.edu (130.207.226.24) in ./pub/TeX. The variety here
       is sbtex version 30 by Wayne Sullivan. EmTeX, another TeX package 
       for the PC by Eberhard Mattes, is available via anonymous ftp from 
       ftp.uni-stuttgart.de (129.69.8.13) in 
       ./tex-archive/systems/msdos/emtex and also from niord.shsu.edu
       (192.92.115.8) in [.emtex]. This package includes LaTeX, METAFONT,
       BibTeX, etc., as well. Documentation is available in both German 
       and English.

       All Public Domain TeX software for the PC is also available 
       through TUG. A catalog is available free from them at the 
       address given in question 11. This collection is maintained by 
       Jon Radel, who will answer technical questions on the material 
       (with no service guarantee). Send electronic mail to jon@radel.com.

    Mac - see question 7 for a public domain version (OzTeX). Another version
       is CMacTeX, which has TeX 3.14, METAFONT 2.7, a screen previewer,
       dvips, a PostScript printing utility for the LaserWriter, and some font
       managing utilities. It is available from the CTAN archives discussed
       in question 22. 

    TOPS-20 - TeX was originally written on a DEC-10 under WAITS, and so
       was easily ported to TOPS-20. A Distribution that runs on TOPS-20 
       is available via anonymous ftp from science.utah.edu 
       (128.110.198.2) in ./pub/tex/pub/web.

    VAX/VMS - TeX for VMS is available from any CTAN site (see question 22)
       in the directory ./systems/vms. Standard tape distribution is 
       through DECUS or Maria Code.

    Atari - TeX is available for the Atari ST from atari.archive.umich.edu
       (141.211.165.41) in ./atari/tex. If anonymous ftp is not available
       to you, send a message containing the line ``help'' to
       atari@atari.archive.umich.edu. The mail server can uuencode
       binary files. Another version can be obtained via anonymous
       ftp from ifi.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de (129.69.211.1) in
       ./pub/atari.st/tex. There is also lots of TeX stuff for the
       Atari on the rusinfo and ftp.cs.ruu.nl archives mentioned in
       question 22.

    Amiga - A full implementation of TeX 3.1 call PasTeX and METAFONT 2.7
        are available via anonymous ftp from merlin.etsu.edu (192.43.199.20)
        in ./ab20/AMIGA. It is also available via anonymous ftp from
        forwiss.uni-passau.de (132.231.20.10) in ./pub/amiga/tex. 
        You can also order a CDROM containing this and other amiga software
        from Walnut Creek CDROM, (510) 947-5997.

    Tandy 6000 - If you are interested in building TeX on this machine
        contact Ken Yap (ken@syd.dit.csiro.au), and he'll help you.

20) Where can I get a thesis style for LaTeX?

    Thesis styles are usually very specific to your University, so it's
    usually not profitable to ask the whole newsgroup for one. If you
    want to write your own, a good place to start is the ucthesis style
    available from any CTAN archive in macros/latex/contrib/ucthesis
    (see question 22).

21) How do I get symbols for ``the real numbers'', ``the complex numbers'',
    and so on?

    These symbols are known as ``blackboard bold'' and are available in
    the AMS fonts ``msam'' (e.g., ``msam10'' for 10pt) and ``msbm''. 
    They replace the older ``msxm'' and ``msym''. The fonts have a large
    number of mathematical symbols to supplement the ones 
    provided by TeX. The fonts are available via anonymous ftp from
    e-math.ams.com (130.44.1.100) in the directory ./ams/amsfonts.
    Two files which load the fonts and define the symbols are provided,
    and both work with either TeX or LaTeX. Questions or suggestions 
    regarding these fonts should be directed to 
    tech-support@math.ams.com.

    A set of LaTeX macros for a ``lazy person's'' blackboard bold are:
       \newcommand{\R}{{\sf R\hspace*{-0.9ex}\rule{0.15ex}%
       {1.5ex}\hspace*{0.9ex}}}
       \newcommand{\N}{{\sf N\hspace*{-1.0ex}\rule{0.15ex}%
       {1.3ex}\hspace*{1.0ex}}}
       \newcommand{\Q}{{\sf Q\hspace*{-1.1ex}\rule{0.15ex}%
       {1.5ex}\hspace*{1.1ex}}}
       \newcommand{\C}{{\sf C\hspace*{-0.9ex}\rule{0.15ex}%
       {1.3ex}\hspace*{0.9ex}}}

22) What repositories of TeX material are available, and how can I access
    them?
 
    To aid the archiving and retrieval of of TeX-related files, a TUG
    working group developed the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network
    (CTAN).  Each CTAN site has identical material, and maintains
    authoritative versions of its material.  These collections are
    extensive; in particular, almost everything mentioned in this
    document is archived at the CTAN sites, even if not explicitly
    stated.

    The CTAN sites are currently ftp.uni-stuttgart.de (129.69.8.13)
    with the TeX root directory ./pub/tex, ftp.tex.ac.uk
    (134.151.44.19) with root directory ./pub/archive, and
    pip.shsu.edu (192.92.115.10) with root directory ./tex-archive.
    Under the root directory, the organization is identical.

    To find software at a CTAN site, use anonymous ftp to the host,
    and then execute the command `quote site index <search-term>'.

    The mail servers of the CTAN sites are not yet identical, but this is
    planned. Here are the current methods of access via electronic mail:
      - For the UK site, send a message to texserver@tex.ac.uk. The
        first non-blank line of the message must contain a valid
        TeXserver command (help, directory, files, whereis, search,
        or path). The program will then mail you a response notifying
        you that your request has been received. If you fail to get a
        response from the TeXserver, you may need to use the ``path''
        command to help the program out. For Internet users the
        return address is of the form name%site@nsfnet-relay, while
        for Bitnet and EARN it is name%site@earn-relay (i.e., include
        a line that says ``path name%site@nsfnet-relay'' along with a
        line containing ``help''). 
      - For ftp.uni-stuttgart.de, send a message containing the line
        ``help'' to mail-server@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de.
      - For the SHSU site, send a message with the line HELP to
        FILESERV@SHSU.BITNET. SENDME FILELIST will get an annotated
        listing of all packages available there.

    The host nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40) mirrors ftp.uni-stuttgart.de
    in /mirrors/tex, as does ftp.uni-bielefeld.de (129.70.4.55) in
    /pub/tex. Src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1) mirrors ftp.tex.ac.uk in
    /packages/TeX/uk-tex/. Finally, wuarchive.wustl.edu
    (128.252.135.4) mirrors pip.shsu.edu in /packages/TeX.

    There are several other repositories of TeX material available:
      - ftp.cs.ruu.nl (131.211.80.17) also contains a substantial TeX
        archive with ftp access. To use it via email, send a message
        containing the line ``help'' to mail-server@cs.ruu.nl. This mail 
        server can send binary files in a variety of different formats.
      - There are LISTSERV facilities for TeX at LISTSERV@DHDURZ1.BITNET. 
        Send a message containing the line ``help'' to this address.
      - For users on BITNET, access to anonymous ftp for some files can
        be obtained indirectly by sending mail to BITFTP@PUCC.BITNET.
        Send a message containing the line ``help'' to this address for
        more information.
     
    There is also the DECUS TeX collection, a collection of TeX material
    for VMS, Unix, MS-DOS, and the Macintosh. It is available via 
    anonymous ftp from wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4) in ./decus/tex.
    It can also be obtained from the DECUS Library (reference number 
    VS0058) in the US, or through your DECUS office outside of the US. To 
    contact the DECUS Library, send mail or call:
                 The DECUS Program Library
                 219 Boston Post Road BP02
                 Marlboro, MA 01752-1850
                 (508)480-3418
    or send electronic mail to the DECUS TeX Collection Editor, Ted 
    Nieland, at decus_tex@nieland.dayton.oh.us.
     
    Another good source of information is NETWORK SOURCES OF TeX WARE by
    Peter Flynn which appeared in TeXhax, volume 90, issues 45-47 (in
    May 1990).      

23) How do I use PostScript fonts with LaTeX?

    The best way to do this is to install the New Font Selection
    Scheme (NFSS) (see question 35), and use the psnfss package
    written by Sebastian Rahtz. It is available from all the major
    archives mentioned in question 22. Unfortunately, on some it is
    known as soton and on others as psnfss. The definitive home for
    it is the UK TeX archive, tex.ac.uk (134.151.40.18) in
    [tex-archive.macros.latex.distribs.psnfss]. Other methods for using
    PostScript fonts in LaTeX are cumbersome at best.

24) How can I convert from format Y to TeX or LaTeX, and vice-versa?

    troff - TROFF-TO-LATEX.TAR-Z is available via anonymous ftp from
      wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20) in the directory 
      pd2:<unix-c.textproc>. This program, written by Kamal Al-Yahya 
      at Stanford, assists in the translation of a troff document into 
      LaTeX format.  It recognizes most -ms and -man macros, plus most 
      eqn and some tbl preprocessor commands. Anything fancier needs 
      to be done by hand.  Two style files are provided.  There 
      is also a man page (which converts very well to LaTeX :-).  
      The program is copyrighted but free. An enhanced version of this
      program, tr2latex, is available from 
      ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de (137.226.112.172) in ./pub/TeX. 
      The DECUS TeX distribution (see question 22) also contains a program
      which converts troff to TeX. If you are interested in obtaining a copy
      of this program without getting the entire DECUS TeX distribution, 
      send the command: SENDME TROFFTOTEX in the body of a mail message to
      FILESERV@SHSU.BITNET (FILESERV@SHSU.edu), or use anonymous ftp to the
      directory [.TROFFTOTEX] on Niord.SHSU.edu (192.92.115.8). 

    scribe - Mark James has a copy of scribe2latex he has been
      unable to test but which he will let anyone interested have.
      Send email to jamesm@procor.dialogic.com. The program was written
      by Van Jacobson of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.

    wordperfect -  wp2latex.zip is available on wuarchive.wustl.edu
      (128.252.135.4) in the directory ./mirrors/msdos/tex and on
      wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20) in the directory pd1:<msdos.tex>.
      This is a PC program written in Turbo Pascal by R. C. Houtepen at
      the Eindhoven University in the Netherlands.  It converts
      WordPerfect 5.0 documents to LaTeX.  Pascal source is included.
      Users find it ``helpful'' and ``decent'' in spite of some
      limitations. It gets high marks for handling font changes.
      Limitations include no indices, table of contents, margins or
      graphics.  It also won't handle the new features of WordPerfect
      5.1, in particular the equation formatter. The program is
      copyrighted but free.

      Glenn Geers of the University of Sydney (glenn@qed.physics.su.oz.au)
      is translating wp2latex into C and adding some WordPerfect 5.1
      features, in particular its equation handling.  This is an ongoing
      project; the most recent version can be retrieved via anonymous ftp
      from suphys.physics.su.oz.au (129.78.129.1) in ./wp2latex. It was 
      posted to alt.sources on 8 August 1990.

      Commercial packages are available for DOS which convert from
      WordPerfect to LaTeX, and from TeX and LaTeX to WordPerfect, but
      I am unaware of any free products which do this.

    PC-Write - pcwritex.arc is available on wuarchive.wustl.edu
      (128.252.135.4) in directory mirrors/msdos/tex and on
      wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20) in directory pd1:<msdos.tex>.
      This is a print driver for PC-Write that ``prints'' a PC-Write V2.71
      document to a TeX-compatible disk file.  It was written by Peter
      Flynn at University College, Cork, Ireland.  It is public domain.  

    runoff - Peter Vanroose (vanroose@esat.kuleuven.ac.be) has 
      written a RUNOFF-to-TeX conversion program in VMS Pascal.  It is 
      available from comp.text archives (they do exist, don't they?  The 
      program was submitted in December 1987) or from the author 
      (peter@dit.lth.se) or from Mark James (jamesm@procor.dialogic.com).

    refer/Tib - There are a few programs for converting bibliographic data 
      between BibTeX and refer/Tib formats.  They are available via 
      anonymous ftp from ftp.ai.mit.edu (128.52.32.11) in the 
      directory ./pub/refer-to-bibtex.  In spite of the directory name, 
      it also contains a  shell script to convert BibTeX to REFER as 
      well. Unfortunately, this collection is not maintained.

    RTF - A program for converting Microsoft's Rich Text Format to TeX
      is available via anonymous ftp from astro.princeton.edu
      (128.112.128.131) in ./pub/rtf2TeX.tar.Z. It was written and is
      maintained by Robert Lupton (rhl@astro.princeton.edu). There is
      also an rtf2LateX written by Erwin Wechtl available from 
      ftp.vmars.tuwien.ac.at (128.130.39.16) in ./pub/misc.

    Microsoft Word - A rudimentary program for converting MS-Word
      to LaTeX is wd2latex, for MS-DOS, available via anonymous ftp
      from any CTAN site (see question 22). A better idea, however, 
      is to convert the document to RTF format and use the RTF 
      converter mentioned above.
    
    In addition, a group at Ohio State University is working on a common
    document format based on SGML.  In theory any format could be
    translated to or from this one.  Also, Framemaker supposedly has
    ``import filters'' to aid in the translation from alien formats
    (presumably including TeX) to Framemaker; perhaps other desktop
    publishing programs have similar things.
      
25) How do I get a file into the major style repositories?
    
    Use anonymous ftp to any CTAN archive (see question 22) and
    retrieve the file README.uploads in the root directory. It contains
    instructions for uploading files and notifying the appropriate
    people for that site.

    If you cannot use ftp, mail your contribution to sty-mgr@shsu.edu
    and it will be passed along. You will make everyone's life easier
    if you choose a descriptive and unique name for your submission, so
    it's probably good idea to browse through some of the styles
    already available to insure your style file's name is not already
    in use.

26) Where can I get font Y?

    A comprehensive list of METAFONT fonts is posted to Comp.fonts
    about once every six weeks by Lee Quin (lee@sq.sq.com). It contains
    both commercial fonts and fonts available via anonymous ftp. Most
    of the fonts available via anonymous ftp are available from
    the CTAN archives (see question 22). Also, the file wujastyk.txh
    ./tex-archive/digests/texhax/txh/wujastyk.txh is a copy of
    Dominik Wujastyk's font article, and contains information on
    METAFONT fonts as well.

27) Where can I get a dvi driver for the HP LaserJet?

    PC - The emtex package mentioned in question 19 contains a driver for
       the LaserJet, dvihplj. 

    Version 2.10 of the Beebe drivers support the LaserJet. These drivers
    will compile under Unix, VMS, and on the Atari ST and DEC-20's. They
    are available from science.utah.edu (128.110.198.2) in ./pub/tex/dvi.

28) TeX and LaTeX are hyphenating words weirdly. What can I do?

    You have a version mismatch problem. The hyphenation algorithm changed
    between version 2.9 and 3.0. If you are using TeX version 3.0 or
    later, make sure you have plain.tex and lplain.tex files with a
    version number of at least 3.0.

    For those of you curious about the change, here's what happened:
    in versions of TeX before 3.0 the hyphenation algorithm would not
    break a word if the part before the break was not at least two
    characters long, and the part after the break at least three 
    characters long. Starting with version 3.0 two integer parameters,
    \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin, control the length of these
    fragments. These are set to 2 and 3, respectively, in the new
    plain and lplain formats. They can be set to any value, of course,
    but if \lefthyphenmin + \righthyphenmin is greater than 62, all
    hyphenation is suppressed.

29) How can I convert a TeX or LaTeX file into a plain ASCII file,
    with all the formatting intact, a la nroff?

    Ralph Droms (droms@bucknell.edu) has a style file and a C program
    that provide the LaTeX equivalent of nroff. Although it doesn't do
    a good job with tables and math, it's the best way to convert that
    I've seen. The software is available for anonymous ftp from
    sol.cs.bucknell.edu (134.82.1.8) in ./droms/txt-dist.tar.

    Another possibility is to use screen.sty, available from all the
    major archives. However you need a program called crudetype to
    process the resulting dvi file. It is available from
    emx.utexas.edu (128.83.186.11) in
    ./pub/mnt/source/tex/tex-3.0/DVIware/lpr-viewers/crudetype and
    from ftp.uni-stuttgart.de (129.69.8.13) in
    ./tex-archive/dviware/screenview. Another possibility is to use
    the LaTeX-to-ASCII conversion program, l2a, available from
    comp.sources.misc archives (one archive site is ftp.uu.net
    (192.48.96.9)), although this is really more of a de-TeXing
    program. If you are running under Unix and have C++ and perl, you
    might try Jonathan Monsarrat's LameTeX package (which actually
    does much more than this), available from wilma.cs.brown.edu
    (128.148.33.66) in ./pub/lametex.tar.Z.

30) How do I enlarge TeX? I keep getting `memory capacity exceeded'
    errors.

    Most of the time, a ``memory capacity exceeded'' error can be fixed
    without enlarging TeX.  The most common causes are unmatched braces,
    extra-long lines, and poorly-written macros.  Extra-long lines
    are often introduced when files are transferred incorrectly between
    operating systems.  (The tell-tale sign of an extra-long line error
    is when the complaint is that the `buf_size' has overflowed.)

    If you really need to extend your TeX's capacity, the proper method
    varies depending on your installation.  In the purest form, you
    change the parameters in module 11 (``The following parameters can
    be changed...'')  In less pure forms, you might need to modify a
    change file, or perhaps change some environment variables.  Consult
    the documentation that came with your particular implementation.

31) In LaTeX, I used \pagestyle{empty}, but the first page is still 
    numbered. What do I do?

    If you see this problem, you are using the \maketitle command too.
    This is a bug in LaTeX. The workaround is to put the command
    \thispagestyle{empty} immediately after the \maketitle command, with
    no blank line between them.

32) Where do I find documentation about BibTeX?

    BibTeX, a program originally designed to produce bibliographies in
    conjunction with LaTeX, is explained in Section 4.3 and Appendix B 
    of Leslie Lamport's LaTeX manual.  The ``BibTeXing'' document, 
    contained in the file btxdoc.tex, gives a more complete description.

    The ``Designing BibTeX Styles'' document, contained in the file 
    btxhak.tex, explains the postfix stack-based language used to
    write BibTeX styles (.bst files).  The file btxbst.doc is the template
    file for the four standard styles (plain, abbrv, alpha, unsrt). It
    also contains the documentation for them.

    The current Unix-BibTeX man page, contained in the file
    bibtex.1, was updated in January 1992 and is about one page long.
    There's an old and obsolete version floating around, written in 1985
    before ``BibTeXing'' and ``Designing BibTeX Styles'' appeared, that is
    several pages long.  You should ignore it (or throw it away), since it
    describes BibTeX version 0.98, style files of which are incompatible 
    with the current version, 0.99 (to be precise, 0.99c).

    All files mentioned in this answer are available via anonymous ftp
    from labrea.stanford.edu (36.8.0.112) in the BibTeX ftp area, 
    tex/bibtex. All the non-Unix files should be available on any system 
    that runs BibTeX; if they're not on your system, please complain to 
    your BibTeX installer or to your distribution source.

33) How do I use BibTeX with plain TeX?

    The file btxmac.tex contains TeX macros and documentation for using
    BibTeX with plain TeX, either directly or with Karl Berry's Eplain
    package. It is available via anonymous ftp from labrea.stanford.edu
    (36.8.0.112) in tex/bibtex (see question 32 for more information 
    about BibTeX).

34) How do I draw Feynman diagrams in LaTeX?

    Michael Levine's macro package for drawing Feynman diagrams in LaTeX
    is available via mail-server from physics.utoronto.ca. Send a message
    containing the line ``send INDEX'' to mail-server@physics.utoronto.ca
    for information on how to retrieve it.

35) What is the New Font Selection Scheme (NFSS)?

    NFSS is an extension to LaTeX written by Frank Mittelbach and Rainer
    Sch\"opf. It is described in TUGboat, volume 10 (1989), No. 2.
    In traditional typesetting, fonts are described by four parameters:
    the family (e.g., computer modern), the series (i.e., the weight and
    width of the font, like light or bold), the shape (e.g., italic), and
    the size. NFSS is a mechanism allowing the user to change any of these
    independently. NFSS makes it relatively easy to use nonstandard fonts
    such as the PostScript ones with LaTeX, and easy to change math fonts.
    It also allows dynamic loading of fonts at runtime (not when the
    format file is created).

    NFSS will be part of version 3.0 of LaTeX. Currently, you need
    to create a new format file to use it. It is available via
    anonymous ftp from all the major archives mentioned in question
    22. Its home is on ftp.uni-stuttgart.de (129.69.8.13) in
    ./tex-archive/macros/latex/distribs/nfss2. NFSS can be used in plain
    TeX as well, through an interface written by Wayne Sullivan.

    There is one caveat that applies to LaTeX documents written for
    the OLD scheme: some of them use special styles for special fonts
    which will not work under the NFSS.

36) In LaTeX, my cross-references for floats (figures and tables) are
    incorrect. What's wrong?

    The \label command must come after the \caption command, or
    be part of it. For example,
       \begin{figure}               \begin{figure}
       \caption{A Figure}    or     \caption{A Figure\label{fig}}
       \label{fig}                  \end{figure}
       \end{figure}

37) I want to change the margins in LaTeX. What can I do?

    This answer first helps you change the margins throughout a
    document, then tells you how to change the margins in a portion
    of the document.

    Perhaps the easiest way to get more out of a page in LaTeX is to
    get fullpage.sty, available from all the major archive servers
    mentioned in question 22. This sets the margins of the page identical
    to those of Plain TeX, i.e., 1-inch margins at all four sides of the
    paper. It also contains an adjustment for A4 paper.

    Here is a brief explanation of what's going on with the page
    parameters in LaTeX. They are explained in section C.4.2 of the
    LaTeX manual (p. 163). The margin parameters represent measurements
    made to the DVI file. The origin in DVI coordinates is one inch
    from the top of the paper and one inch from the left side. This
    explains the ``one inch less than'' terminology used in the LaTeX
    manual. In DVI coordinates, positive horizontal measurements extend
    right across the page, and positive vertical measurements extend down
    the page. Thus, for margins closer to the left and top edges of the
    page than 1 inch, the corresponding parameters, e.g.,
    \evensidemargin, \oddsidemargin, \topmargin, can be set to negative
    values.

    Finally, to change the margins of a document within the document,
    modifying the parameters listed on page 163 will not work. They
    can only be changed in the preamble of the document, i.e, before
    the \begin{document} statement. To adjust the margins within a
    document we define an environment which does it:
      \newenvironment{changemargin}[2]{\begin{list}{}{
         \setlength{\topsep}{0pt}\setlength{\leftmargin}{0pt}
         \setlength{\rightmargin}{0pt}
         \setlength{\listparindent}{\parindent}
         \setlength{\itemindent}{\parindent}
         \setlength{\parsep}{0pt plus 1pt}
         \addtolength{\leftmargin}{#1}\addtolength{\rightmargin}{#2}
         }\item }{\end{list}}
    This environment takes two arguments, and will indent the left
    and right margins by their values, respectively. Negative values
    will cause the margins to be widened, so
    \begin{changemargin}{-1cm}{-1cm} widens the left and right margins
    by 1cm.

38) How do I find the width of a letter, word, or phrase in TeX?

    Put the word in a box, and measure the width of the box. For example,
        \setbox0=\hbox{hi}
        width=\wd0
    Note that if the quantity in the hbox is a phrase, the actual 
    measurement only approximates this width, since the interword glue
    can be adjusted in paragraph mode.

    In LaTeX, the following works (taken from the manual):
        \newlength{\gnat}
        \settowidth{\gnat}{\em small}
    This sets the value of the length command \gnat to the width of ``small''
    in emphasized text.

39) In LaTeX, is there a comment or ``ignore'' environment with which
    I can exclude blocks of text from the .dvi file?

    Rainer Sch\"opf's verbatim.sty provides a comment environment which
    excludes everything between \begin{comment} and \end{comment}. It is
    available via anonymous ftp from any CTAN site (see question 22) in
    ./tex-archive/macros/latex/distribs. Several files are needed to
    install the package. A more general environment for doing this is
    comment.sty, also available from the CTAN sites in
    ./tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc.

40) Where can I find a spelling checker for my TeX file?

    For Unix, ispell is probably the program of choice. It is available
    from any CTAN site (see question 22) in ./tex-archive/support/ispell.

    For DOS, jspell is an extended version of ispell, and is available via
    anonymous ftp from oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117) in 
    ./pub/msdos/tex/jspell*.zip.
