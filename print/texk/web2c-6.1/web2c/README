This directory contains web2c, a system which converts TeX, Metafont,
and other related WEB programs to C.  It is not a complete TeX
distribution. Nor is it a general-purpose Pascal-to-C translator.

web2c is electronically distributed in two files: the web files, in
web.tar.gz, and the web2c-specific files, in web2c.tar.gz. If you
already have the web files for a particular Knuthian version, you need
not re-retrieve them. web2c changes irregularly wrt Knuth's updates.

The file INSTALL contains installation instructions.

The file MACHINES contains a list of configurations that have passed the
trip and trap test.  If your configuration is not on this list, you
should build triptex and trapmf (instructions in INSTALL), and then send
mail to tex-k@cs.umb.edu with the vital statistics, and, of course, any
necessary changes, preferably in the form of context diffs, with
ChangeLog entries.

The file PROBLEMS describes various difficulties people have
encountered.  If you have trouble getting the distribution up, look here
first.  Also look in ./MACHINES.

The files COPYING* describe copying conditions for some parts of
this distribution.

If you know enough about TeX to be reading this, then you (or perhaps
your institution) should consider joining the TeX Users Group.  TUG
produces a periodical (TUGboat), sponsors an annual meeting (the
proceedings of which are published as an issue of TUGboat), and arranges
courses on TeX for all levels of users.  Given sufficient funding (which
your joining will help), TUG could sponsor more projects that will
benefit the TeX community (such as a successor to TeX $\pi$).  Here is
the address:

Changing constants
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The files tex/small.sed and mf/small.sed contain changes to the TeX and
Metafont change files to produce programs using less memory, pool space,
etc. than the defaults.  These patches are applied automatically by
`configure' when you define `SMALLTeX' resp. `SMALLMF' in c-auto.h.in.
The TeX/MF that results will have a larger text segment and run slower,
because it has to convert frequently between 16-bit and 32-bit integers.
On the other hand, the binary will need less swap space.

Similarly, the file bibtex/small.sed changes some of the constants in
the default BibTeX to smaller values.  The default values are necessary
for some databases (see math.utah.edu:pub/tex/bib), but are rather large.

If configure fails to apply the patches, you can do so yourself with, e.g.:
% cd tex; sed -f small.sed < tex.ch > ctex.ch

I recommend the GNU version of patch, available from
prep.ai.mit.edu:pub/gnu and many other archives.

If you want to have more than 256 fonts, you might try this patch.  I
haven't installed it in the main change file because it requires
changing max_quarterword. (This patch will not apply cleanly to the
current sources, but it should be easy enough to fix up. If you do so,
please send me the corrected version.)

I have applied these diffs to web2c 5.851b with a corrected
WORDS_BIGENDIAN configuration file and *no* changes to `texmfmem.h'.
(Changes are only needed for little-endian machines.)

The changed bigTeX is able to load more than 284 fonts before the
font_mem of 100.000 words overflows (it's a good idea to increment
`font_mem_size' when using more than 256 fonts).  `xdvi' and `dvips'
can print the resulted dvi file without problem.

The new constant `max_font_max' is necessary, if you want different
values of `font_max' in initex and virtex. (`max_font_max' is the
space reserved in eqtb[] for the font identifiers; in the original
source there is space for 256 font identifier.)

Here is another patch you might like to apply, this one to make the
font_info structure take less space.

Date: Tue, 7 Sep 93 10:30:50 BST
From: wgs@maths.ucd.ie (Wayne G. Sullivan)

In moving from 5.851c to 5.851d I decided to try an idea which has been
lurking in the subconcious for some time. Four byte words suffice for
the font_info array, so I defined a union fmemory_word scaled/qqqq. It
took a bit of fiddling and I had to use a hack: I defined fmemory_word
in the pascal file as a struct which was included in ifdef/endif so as
not to be seen by c, and gave the union def in texmfmem.h. Anyway it
seems to work and does not involve much effort. The only other changes
needed are in the declaration of font_info and in the debug procedure
which prints out all forms of a memory word -- actually, one should
not call this procedure for entries in font_info. The point in making
this change is that the tex program uses less memory and formats files
are about 15% smaller, depending on the font data stored. Though I have
done no timing tests, there should be no speed difference.

Format files and preloading
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

TeX (and Metafont; I'll talk about TeX, but MF is completely analogous)
can write its memory to a file; such a file is called a ``format file''.
Why is this interesting?  Because TeX can read a format file much faster
than the source file that gave rise to it.

To create a format file, you give the command `\dump' to initex after
reading the source file.  (This is more or less the raison d'etre for
initex.)  For example:
prompt$ initex
This is TeX, C Version 3.0
**plain \dump
<blurbs>
Starting to dump on file plain.fmt
<more blurbs>

Voila, you have a plain.fmt you can install somewhere with `make
install-formats' (or cp, or whatever).

The `formats' target in ./Makefile and tex/Makefile does the above for the
formats defined by the make variable $(formats).

Unlike all the other files in the TeX world, format files are not
perfectly portable.  web2c itself writes the format files in BigEndian
order (if NO_FMTBASE_SWAP is left undefined); for formats which do not
dump any floating-point (e.g., |glue_ratio|) information, this suffices
to make them portable across architectures.  Most formats (including
plain) do not do this.  But you should always check.  (If you do compare
format files dumped on different architectures, don't be alarmed by a
few bytes' difference -- the date is also in the .fmt file.)

Well, I said Metafont is completely analogous, but you actually need to
do a little more: create a file that defines your local output devices
(i.e., ``mode_defs'').  A collection of most existing Metafont modes is
available by ftp from ftp.cs.umb.edu:pub/tex/modes.mf, or by email from
me, karl@cs.umb.edu.  Using modes.mf for your local modes wastes a
little bit of Metafont's memory (because it defines modes which you will
almost certainly never use), but it has several advantages: you can be
sure that your fonts will be identical to others'; you get extra
information added to your fonts; you don't have to experiment to find
your own settings.  modes.mf also explains what goes into a mode_def,
and how to use Metafont with different devices.

Once you have such a file, you say something like the following:
prompt$ inimf
This is METAFONT, C Version 2.0
**plain
<blurbs>
*input modes
<blurbs>
*dump
<final blurbs>

and you should have a file `plain.base', analogous to TeX's `plain.fmt'.

The target `bases' in ./Makefile and mf/Makefile does the above for the
bases defined by the make variable $(bases).

TeX uses the name it was invoked with to figure out what format file to
read.  Therefore, for each format file, you should create a link to the
virtex executable named the name of the format file.  For example:
	cd $(bindir)
	ln virtex tex
	ln virtex latex
	ln virtex texinfo

Then, when you run, say,
texinfo
TeX looks for a format file named `texinfo.fmt'.
All of this goes for Metafont, too.
The Makefile tries to install these links automatically.

One more thing about format (and base) files: It is possible to
``preload'' TeX, i.e., avoid reading the .fmt file at runtime.  However,
on most modern machines, you don't gain a lot of startup time, and you
lose a lot of disk space.  Furthermore, different flavors of TeX will
not have their code segments shared.  Therefore, it is probably best not
to preload unless, of course, it takes your machine eons to load a
format file.

You may be wondering what the formats listed in ./Makefile are.  Here is
a brief description:

tex:
        from plain.tex; described in the TeXbook.  The Makefile also
        installs tex.fmt as plain.fmt, so that the constructions
        described in the TeXbook will work.  Canonical source is
        labrea.stanford.edu.
latex:
	from lplain.tex and latex.tex; described in the LaTeX manual,
        by Leslie Lamport, published by Addison-Wesley.  Best
        source is rusmv1.rus.uni-stuttgart.de.
slitex:
	LaTeX for making slides; also described in the LaTeX manual.
texinfo:
	from texinfo.tex; almost-completely logical markup (much more so
        than LaTeX); can be translated into an Info document, which is
        readable online.  Described in documentation that comes with the
        macros.  Canonical source is prep.ai.mit.edu.
amstex:
        from amstex.tex; especially for mathematical papers; described
        in the Joy of TeX, by Michael Spivak, published by the American
        Mathematical Society.  Canonical source is e-math.ams.com.
amslatex:
	a combination of AMSTeX and LaTeX; incompatible with the
        original LaTeX, because it uses Mittelbach and Schoepf's ``new
        font selection scheme''.  Described in documentation that comes
        with the macros.  Canonical source is e-math.ams.com.
etex:
        from eplain.tex; macros for common facilities that plain does
        not have, e.g., symbolic cross-referencing.  Described in
        documentation that comes with the macros.  Canonical source is
        ftp.cs.umb.edu.
inrstex:
	from inrstex.tex; an alternative to LaTeX, with excellent
        support for non-English supports.  Described in documentation
        that comes with the macros.  Canonical source is
        aldebaran.ee.mcgill.ca.
picplus:
        from picplus.tex; helps to make pictures; described in the
        PiCTeX manual, by Michael Wichura, published by the TeX Users
        Group.

You can get more information about these packages and order the manuals
from tug@math.ams.org.



Directory hierarchies
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

TeX and its friends use many different sorts of files: fonts, macros,
format dumps, pool files, etc.  When you install TeX, you have to decide
how everything should be organized.

The most painful thing to organize is the fonts.  There are both the
.tfm files, which TeX and some DVI-readers need, and the PXL/GF/PK
files, one for each point size and resolution, which only the
DVI-readers look at.  Here are some of the common approaches:

1) Put everything in one directory, say /usr/local/lib/tex/fonts. 
Advantages: it's simple; everything is together; it's easy to tell if a
particular file exists.  Disadvantage: the directory is huge.

2) Put each set of pixel files at a given resolution (i.e.,
magnification) in a different directory, and put the TFM files in
another directory.  Advantage: the directories are smaller. 
Disadvantage: the files for any given typeface are not together.

3) Put each typeface family in a different subdirectory; e.g., have
subdirectories `cm' (Computer Modern), `pandora', `euler', etc.
Advantage: the files for a given typeface are together.  Disadvantage:
many DVI-readers will not automatically look in subdirectories of
TEXFONTS.  However, dvips (perhaps the most widely used
dvi-to-PostScript translator), and xdvi (a previewer running under X11)
both know how to search subdirectories, and I've modified them to use
the same algorithm as TeX and friends; my modified versions are on
ftp.cs.umb.edu:pub/tex.

See tex.man for more details on path searching.

#3 is the default organization in the Makefiles as distributed.
See the file kpathsea/HIER for additional information.



Online output from Metafont
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Metafont in C can be compiled to support multiple window systems.  You
say which you want via definitions in `c-auto.h.in'.

There are two versions of the X11 support in mf/MFwindow.  One is based
on Xt, one on Xlib.  The Xt version is faster and has more
functionality, so if it works on your system, you should use it.  It is
the default.  But if it fails, you can try the Xlib version.

There are also two versions of the Sun support in mf/MFwindow.  One is
based on Sunview, the other on Suntools (i.e., the gfx_hs structure).
The former has more functionality, and it works on recent versions of
SunOS, so it is the default.

Defining more devices is fairly straightforward.  Put the new file with
the actual device support in mf/MFwindow.  Then add another entry to the
tables at the end of `lib/texmf.c'; that should be it.



Porting and portability
%%%%%%%%%%%

The C code generated by the web2c translator is intended to be as
portable as possible.  If you find bugs or portability problems with the
generated code, report them to karl@cs.umb.edu.

The generated code assumes that the type `short' has at least the range
-32768..32767, and that `unsigned short' has at least the range
0..65535.  If this isn't the case, the translator will have to be modified.

Since the code is generated automatically, it is foolish to edit it by
hand.  Instead, you should fix the `web2c' program, or perhaps add
commands to the `convert' scripts.  (And you should also report your
changes to the bug address in ../README.)

On another front, the `convert' scripts assume some basic Unix
utilities: basename, cat, cp, diff, ln, make, mv, rm, sed, and touch.
The Bourne shell is also assumed.  If your system versions are broken,
you can try the GNU versions, available by anonymous ftp from
prep.ai.mit.edu in pub/gnu, among many other places.  The GNU C compiler
is also better (more reliable, faster, and produces better code) than
many other C compilers, so you might want to get that.  For more
information about the GNU project, write to gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu.
