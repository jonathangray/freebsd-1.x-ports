Donald Knuth conceived and implemented TeX and Metafont.

web2c is primarily the product of Tim Morgan <morgan@ics.uci.edu>.

Tomas Rokicki wrote the original TeX to C program.

Pierre Mackay wrote the original change files for most of the
Metafontware programs.

Karl Berry <karl@cs.umb.edu> made everything work with the ``8-bit''
release of TeX and Metafont (version 3 and 2, respectively).  Karl is
the current maintainer, and is the `I' in most of the code and
documentation.

Dozens of other people have contributed to porting, bug fixes, and other
improvements.  (The names are recorded in ChangeLog, when I remembered.)
