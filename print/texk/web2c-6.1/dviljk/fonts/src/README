This files were used with fontinst 1.317 to create the VF/TFM files for
the HP builtin font in TeX-compatible encodings.

The GNUmakefile is probably of no use as-is to anyone but me; it depends
on lots of my development pathnames, etc.

{0n,10u,2n,6j,7j,8u,9t}.etx are encoding files I made up for the HP
encodings that I used. I chose which encodings to use based on (all
other factors being equal) how many fonts had that encoding available.
There are many other HP encodings. Norm (Walsh) created the builtin
fonts in all of them, and you can use them directly if you wish.

*.etw are bits of encoding files that are repeated in all the encodings.

*.map and k2n.awk are used by the GNUmakefile to go from Norm's names to mine.

etxmac.tex, fontdim.tex, fonthp.tex, and uclc.tex are utility TeX macros
used to make the encoding files shorter and avoid duplication.

fontinst.rc defines \HEADER (to do nothing), since our fonts have extra
headerbyte info.  This will presumably appear in fontinst proper at some
point.

hptex.tex could be read by (plain) TeX documents to take advantage of
the extra characters in the plain-compatible encoding.

latin.mtx is the usual fontinst one minus the smallcap definitions. I
found that my (big) TeX ran out of memory with the smallcap definitions,
and my encodings don't use them, so ...

oneline.tex creates a document with one-line showings of all the builtin
fonts. You'll need to apply the following patch to dvicopy to process
the resulting dvi files.

rmligdups.awk is necessary because we have (much) duplicate kerning info
in our fonts. Given two entries for a kerning pair (X,Y) fontinst writes
them both, instead of just the latter. The result is a VPL file that's
too big for vptovf (and maybe too big for the TFM/VF formats at all, I forget).

test.tex uses testfont.tex routines to exercise the fonts.

Change dvicopy.ch to this if you want to. This suffices to expand oneline.dvi.
