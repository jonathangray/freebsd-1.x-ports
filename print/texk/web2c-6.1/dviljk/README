This directory contains dviljk, my (kb@cs.umb.edu) modified version of
Gustaf Neumann's dvi2xx.  See `ChangeLog' or `Makefile.in' for the version
number.  See `NEWS' for changes by release.

The file `INSTALL' explains the installation process, which I changed to
use a GNU-style (Autoconf-generated) `configure' script to guess
system-dependent information, instead of requiring the installer to do
everything in the Makefile.

Aside from configuration, this differs from the original primarily in
that it uses the same code for path searching as TeX, the GNU font
utilities, and dvipsk/xdvik (my similarly-modified dvips/xdvi).  I
haven't tested the DOS or other non-Unix support present in the
original, or support for any device but the LJ4. And I've moved the
nonessential files to a directory `contrib', and renamed the man page to
dvilj.1.

It also supports the builtin LaserJet 4 fonts (TFM's and VF's are in the
fonts subdirectory). I've sent the changes necessary for this to Gustaf,
and presumably they will appear in some future release. Thanks to Norm
Walsh for doing the real work of making the fonts from HP's files. See
fonts/README for more info.

Please report bugs to tex-k@cs.umb.edu, rather than Gustaf, so he is not
bothered with bugs that aren't in his program.  (Email
tex-k-request@cs.umb.edu with a line containing with a line containing

(The rest of this file is the README from the original dvi2xx distribution.)

The dvi2xx family consists of the following programs:
 
       Dvilj2 converts TeX-output  .dvi  files  into  HP  PCL  (i.e.  HP
       Printer  Control Language) commands suitable for printing on a HP
       LaserJet+, HP LaserJet II and fully compatible printers.
 
       Dvilj2p converts TeX-output .dvi files into HP PCL commands suit-
       able  for  printing  on  a HP LaserJet IIp, HP LaserJet III or HP
       Laserjet 2000 and fully compatible printers. This version uses  a
       newer PCL command set and provides landscape printing.
 
       Dviljp and dvilj are similar to dvilj2p and dvilj2  but they sup-
       port  only 128  character  fonts.  They  may be used for Laserjet
       clones which do not support 256 character fonts.
 
       Dvi3812 converts TeX-output .dvi files into PMP files, the native
       command language of the IBM 3812 page printer.
 
binary versions are available for:
       - aix 3.1 rs6000
       - hpux 7.0 risc
       - msdos
       - os/2
       - ultrix 4.2 risc
       - SunOS 4.1 



=================================================================
Configuration:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Compilation of the program:
	under Unix: Makefile
	in MS-DOS: cut out relevant part of dvi2xx.make 
        under VMS: see README.vms

	config.h
		most important:
		FONTAREA:
			fontpath leading to font directories; can be
			overuled at runtiime by setting the
			environment variable TEXPXL or the command
			line option -a
			default: "/usr/local/lib/tex/pk300"
			(VMS default: "tex$pkdir:")

		MAKETEXPK:
			Name of the program which is called to generate a pk
			file in a missing magnification
			default: "MakeTeXPK"
-----------------------------------------------------------------
execution under MS-DOS:
	CONFIG.SYS:
		files=20
		buffers=30
-----------------------------------------------------------------
MakeTeXPK:
	DESTDIR: 
		Name of the directory where the neewly generated fonts
		should be placed finally 
		default:  /usr/local/lib/tex/pk/pk300

	MF:
		Name of the MetaFont program
		default: cmmf

	MFINPUTS:
		search path for metafont input files for MetaFont
		default: `pwd`:/usr/local/lib/mf/inputs

	TEMPDIR:

		directory for where the MetaFont compilation takes
		place, and where intermediate files are put in, and
		which is removed after the MakeTeXPK run.
		default:  /usr/tmp/mtpk.$$

        be sure that you install MakeTeXPK in a way that it is allowed
        to write to DESTDIR.
        
-----------------------------------------------------------------
lj3-filter:
	location of perl (headerline)             /usr/local/bin/perl
	location of the tmp file (variable $tmpfile)
	name of dvi-filter and its options (variable $dvifilter)
