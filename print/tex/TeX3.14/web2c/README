This file describes web2c, a system which converts TeX, Metafont, and
other products of the Stanford TeX project to C.  (It is definitely not
a general-purpose Pascal-to-C translator.)

web2c is primarily the product of Tim Morgan <morgan@ics.uci.edu>.
Tomas Rokicki wrote the original TeX to C program.  Pierre Mackay
<mackay@cs.washington.edu> wrote the original change files for most of
the Metafontware programs.  Karl Berry <karl@cs.umb.edu> made everything
work with the 8-bit release of TeX and Metafont, and is probably to
blame for things that don't work now, but used to.  And over a hundred
more people have also contributed.

The file ./MACHINES.W2C contains a list of known configurations that
have passed the trip and trap test.  If your configuration is not on
this list, you should build triptex and trapmf (instructions below), and
then send mail to Karl with the vital statistics, and, of course, any
changes you made, preferably in the form of context diffs.

The file ./ChangeLog.W2C records changes to web2c.  The current version number
of web2c can be found at the beginning of that file (and also in the
Makefile).

The file ./PROJECTS.W2C describes some improvements to the current setup
that would be nice to have.

The file ./PROBLEMS.W2C describes various difficulties people have
encountered.  If you have trouble getting the distribution up, look here
first.  You should also look in ./MACHINES.W2C.

The file ./COPYING.W2C describes copying conditions for this software.

We try to keep web2c up-to-date with respect to the master WEB files.
But we can't, always.  The web-*.tar.Z file holds the versions that we
know to work with these change files.  If you get different versions and
encounter any problems, please write to us.

If you know enough about TeX to be reading this, then you (or perhaps
your institution) should consider joining the TeX Users Group.  TUG
produces a quarterly journal (TUGboat), sponsors an annual meeting (the
proceedings of which are published as an issue of TUGboat), and arranges
courses on TeX for all levels of users.  Given sufficient funding (which
your joining will help), TUG could sponsor more projects that will
benefit the TeX community.  Here is the address:

Bootstrapping tangle
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
If you have an already working tangle, you may wish to copy it into the
directory `./web', to omit the bootstrapping step.  If you don't,
web/Makefile will attempt to compile a bootstrap version.  This step can
fail and go into a loop.  If this happens you need to fix the problem
manually.  Possible problems and remedies:

If tangle fails tangling tangle.web:
	tangle.ch may not match tangle.web; get the correct versions.

If tangleboot.c or tanglext.c does not compile:
	Make the converted C files acceptable to your compiler and retry
        (also tell Karl or Tim, so web2c can be fixed).



Installation
%%%%%%%%%%%%
Here is the procedure for getting things running.

0. Copy site.h-dist to site.h.

1. Edit ./site.h and ./Makefile to set up your local paths, compiler,
   etc.  The symbols BSD, SYSV, and the like affect the conversion from
   WEB to C, not just the compilation of the C files.  Therefore, you
   must recompile web2c if you change the definition of these symbols.
   (The Makefile does that automatically if you change site.h, but you
   should be aware of this, anyway.)  If you move ./site.h to another
   directory (i.e., change SITEDIR in Makefile), move ./defaults.h
   there, also.

2. `make triptrap' to build triptex and trapmf (and some of the other 
   programs that are needed to run the tests).

3. `make run-triptrap' to run the tests.  The differences (and many
   error messages) will show up on your terminal.  If you have a
   question about whether the differences are OK or not, consult
   tex/TeXtrip/tripman.tex and mf/MFtrap/trapman.tex.  The most common
   differences are in:
   * glue setting being rounded differently in the TeX log;
   * string space used;
   * the `down4' and `right4' commands in the dvitype output;
   * and the dates and times.
   All these differences are acceptable.

4. `make clean-triptrap' to get rid of the test programs and output.  You
   need to do this before making the working versions.

5. `make' to make the working versions of every program in this
   hierarchy.  If you wish to make a `big' TeX or Metafont, or make a
   TeX with a large hyphenation trie, now is the time to set up for it.
   See the section `Changing constants' below.

6. `make formats' to make the format files you want (the variable `formats'
   in ./Makefile defines the list).  If you don't know what this means,
   see the section `Format files and preloading' below.

7. `make bases' to make the base files for Metafont that you want.
   Besides the variable `bases' in ./Makefile, you may also want to
   change the variable `localmodes'.  It is also a good idea to try to
   draw something online (if you intend to support that) before
   installing Metafont, as this often fails to work right on the first
   try.  See the `Running Metafont' chapter in the Metafontbook.

8. `make install' to install the programs, and `make install-formats
   install-bases' to install the formats/bases to create links to
   `virtex' and `virmf' named for each of the formats and bases that you
   made.  texware/pooltype and texware/patgen are not installed by
   default, even though they are made, since most sites would never want
   to run them.

9. `make manpages' to edit the documentation in `man' for the paths and
   constants you defined in `site.h' and `Makefile'.  Then `make
   install-manpages' to install them.

10. `make clean' if you intend to compile the programs on another
    architecture.  Since the .c files are intended to be portable across
    architectures, they are not removed by this.

11. `make veryclean' when you're all done.  This removes everything that
   was not in the original distribution (and more besides).

If you wish to make just TeX or Metafont, the top-level Makefile has
targets named `TeX' and `MF' which make {ini,vir}{tex,mf}, and nothing
else. Similarly, if you don't want to (or can't) run both the trip and
trap tests, `Makefile' has targets `run-trip' and `run-trap'.

Ordinarily, you don't need to ever `make' anything in subdirectories,
but only from the top-level directory.  If you ever do run `make' in a
subdirectory, you should be aware that they all define their own CC,
OPT, etc. -- and so you will probably want to change them.

You will also need the latest plain.tex, plain.mf, and other macro
files.  You can get them from labrea.stanford.edu, in the directory
tex/lib.  LaTeX's lplain.tex and splain.tex have been updated to work
with TeX 3.0; if your version of these files don't assign to
\lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin, you should get the new versions.



Changing constants
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The files tex/bigtex.diff and mf/bigmf.diff contain patches to build
versions of TeX and Metafont with much more memory, pool space, etc.
You should apply the patches before beginning to compile the programs.
The 32-bit TeX that results (all of this goes for Metafont, too) will
have a smaller text segment and run faster, because it doesn't have to
convert frequently between 16-bit and 32-bit integers.  It is therefore
a good idea to build such a TeX if possible.

The file tex/trie.diff is a patch that allows for more than 256 ops in
TeX's hyphenation trie.  This is useful for some non-English languages.
It was contributed by xitikgun@ddathd21.bitnet.  The file
tex/bigtrie.diff combines trie.diff and bigtex.diff, as you might guess.

You can obtain the patch program, written by Larry Wall
<lwall@jpl-devvax.jpl.nasa.gov> from a comp.sources.unix archive, or by
ftp from his machine (among many other places).  The GNU project has
made some extensions to path; you can get the GNU version from
prep.ai.mit.edu.

You should first save the original c{tex,mf}.ch as ctex16.ch or some
such, because `make veryclean' removes files whose names end in `~',
`.orig', and others, which would probably wipe out the originals.

Then apply the patches by saying, e.g.,
% cd tex; patch < bigtex.diff



Format files and preloading
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
TeX (and Metafont; I'll talk about TeX, but MF is completely analogous)
can write its memory to a file; such a file is called a ``format file''.
Why is this interesting?  Because TeX can read a format file much faster
than the source file that gave rise to it.

To create a format file, you give the command `\dump' to initex after
reading the source file.  (This is more or less the raison d'etre for
initex.)  For example:
% initex
This is TeX, C Version 3.0
**plain \dump
<blurbs>
Starting to dump on file plain.fmt
<more blurbs>

Voila, you have a plain.fmt you can install somewhere with `make
install-formats' (or cp, or whatever).

The `formats' target in ./Makefile and tex/Makefile does the above for the
formats defined by the make variable $(formats).

Unlike all the other files in the TeX world, format files are not
perfectly portable.  web2c itself always writes the format files in
BigEndian order; for formats which do not dump any real (e.g.,
|glue_ratio|) information, this suffices to make them portable across
architectures.   Most formats (including plain) do not do this.  But you
should always check.

Well, I said Metafont is completely analogous, but you actually need to
do a little more: create a file that defines your local output devices
(i.e., ``mode_defs'').  A collection of most existing Metafont modes is
available by ftp from ftp.cs.umb.edu [192.12.26.23]:pub/tex/modes.mf, or
by email from Karl (if you have modes which are not in this file, please
send him mail).  Using modes.mf for your local modes wastes a little bit
of Metafont's memory, but it has several advantages: you can be sure
that your fonts will be identical to others'; you get extra information
added to your fonts; you don't have to experiment to find your own
settings.  modes.mf also explains what goes into a mode_def, and how to
use Metafont with different devices.  (end of commercial)

Once you have such a file, you say something like the following:
% inimf
This is METAFONT, C Version 2.0
**plain
<blurbs>
*input modes
<blurbs>
*dump
<final blurbs>

and you should have a file `plain.base', analogous to TeX's `plain.fmt'.

The target `bases' in ./Makefile and mf/Makefile does the above for the
bases defined by the make variable $(bases).

TeX uses the name it was invoked with to figure out what format file to
read.  Therefore, for each format file, you should create a link to the
virtex executable named the name of the format file.  For example:
% cd $(bindir)
% ln virtex tex
% ln virtex latex
% ln virtex texinfo

Then, when you run, say,
% texinfo
TeX looks for a format file named `texinfo.fmt'.
All of this goes for Metafont, too.
./Makefile tries to install these links automatically.

One more thing about format (and base) files: It is possible to
``preload'' TeX, i.e., avoid reading the .fmt file at runtime.  However,
on most modern machines, you don't gain a lot of startup time, and you
lose a lot of disk space.  Furthermore, different flavors of TeX will
not have their code segments shared.  Therefore, it is probably best not
to preload, unless, of course, you try that and the response is
horrible.

You may be wondering what the formats listed in ./Makefile are.  Here is
a brief description:

tex:
        from plain.tex; described in the TeXbook.  The Makefile also
        installs tex.fmt as plain.fmt, so that the constructions
        described in the TeXbook will work.
latex:
	from lplain.tex and latex.tex; described in the LaTeX manual,
        by Leslie Lamport, published by Addison-Wesley.
slitex:
	LaTeX for making slides; also described in the LaTeX manual.
amstex:
	especially for mathematical papers; described in the Joy of
        TeX, by Michael Spivak, published by the American Mathematical
        Society.
etex:
        from eplain.tex; macros for common facilities that plain does
        not have, e.g., symbolic cross-referencing.  Described in
        documentation that comes with the macros.
picplus:
	helps to make pictures; described in the PiCTeX manual, by
        Michael Wichura, published by the TeX Users Group.

You can get more information about these packages and order the manuals
from TUG.

Here is some data collected by Ken Yap <ken@cs.rochester.edu> on a
Sun 3/60 running Sun Unix 3.4 on preloaded vs. non-preloaded format
files, and also 16-bit vs. 32-bit.

    16 bit, unloaded:  42.1u 1.4s 0:50 86% 10+29k 72+17io 0pf+0w
    16 bit, preloaded: 41.7u 0.9s 0:46 90% 10+27k 4+17io 80pf+0w
    32 bit, unloaded:  42.4u 1.7s 0:47 92% 10+52k 95+17io 0pf+0w
    32 bit, preloaded: 41.6u 1.2s 0:48 88% 10+47k 5+17io 102pf+0w

    It is interesting that i/o is traded off with page faulting, as is to
    be expected. Also 32 bit unloaded runs slightly faster than 16 bit
    unloaded, in spite of more i/o.

Directory hierarchies
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
TeX and its friends use many different sorts of files: fonts, macros,
format dumps, pool files, etc.  When you install TeX, you have to decide
how everything should be organized.

The most painful thing to organize is the fonts.  There are both the
.tfm files, which TeX and some DVI-readers need, and the PXL/GF/PK
files, one for each point size and resolution, which only the
DVI-readers look at.  Here are some of the common approaches:

1) Put everything in one directory, say /usr/local/lib/tex/fonts. 
Advantages: it's simple; everything is together; it's easy to tell if a
particular file exists.  Disadvantage: the directory is huge.

2) Put each set of pixel files at a given resolution (i.e.,
magnification) in a different directory, and put the TFM files in
another directory.  Advantage: the directories are smaller. 
Disadvantage: the files for any given typeface are not together.

3) Put each typeface family in a different subdirectory; e.g., have
subdirectories `cm' (Computer Modern), `pandora', `euler', etc.
Advantage: the files for a given typeface are together.  Disadvantage:
most DVI-readers will not automatically look in subdirectories of
TEXFONTS.  (As of web2c 5.0d, TeX, Metafont, and all their companion
programs look for subdirectories if SEARCH_SUBDIRECTORIES is defined in
site.h at compilation time.)  dvips (perhaps the most widely used
dvi-to-PostScript translator), and xdvi (a previewer running under X11
or X10) both know how to search subdirectories.



Online output from Metafont
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Metafont in C can be compiled to support multiple window systems. 
You say which you want via definitions in `site.h'.  You also have to say
which system libraries should be linked into the library in `./Makefile'..

There are two versions of the X11 support in mf/MFwindow.  One is based
on Xt, one on Xlib.  The Xt version is faster and has more
functionality, so if it works on your system, you should use it.  It is
the default.  But if it fails, you can try the Xlib version.

There are also two version of the Sun support in mf/MFwindow.  One is
based on Sunview, the other on Suntools (i.e., the gfx_hs structure).
The former has more functionality, and it works on recent versions of
SunOS, so it is the default.

Defining more devices is fairly straightforward.  A file should be put
in mf/MFwindow to support the actual interface routines, all of which
are described in the Metafont source.  Then you need to add another
entry to the tables in `mf/extra.c'; that should be it.



Portability
%%%%%%%%%%%
The C code generated by the web2c translator is intended to be as
portable as possible (for any given set of definitions in site.h).  If
you find bugs or portability programs with the generated code, report
them to Tim.

The generated code assumes that the type `short' has at least the range
-32768..32767, and that `unsigned short' has at least the range
0..65535.  If this isn't the case, the translator will have to be
modified.

Also, if you change the type of `integer' in site.h to something other
than `long', you will have to modify web2c/fixwrites.c, since it
generates code to integer output using "%ld", and casts all integral
values to be printed to |long|.

The file common/extra.c defines routines `clearterminal' and
`wakeupterminal', written for machines running BSD.  If you're not on
such a machine, you may wish to write your own version of the routines
(and please send them to Karl).

On another front, various of the `convert' scripts assume some basic
Unix utilities: basename, cat, cp, diff, ln, make, mv, rm, sed, and
touch.  The Bourne shell is also assumed.  If your system versions are
broken, you can try the GNU versions, available by anonymous ftp from
prep.ai.mit.edu in pub/gnu, among many other places.  The GNU C compiler
is also better (more reliable, faster, and produces better code) than
many other C compilers, so you might want to get that.  For more
information about the GNU project, write to gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu.
