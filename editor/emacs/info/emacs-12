Running an External Lisp
========================

   Emacs has facilities for running programs in other Lisp systems.
You can run a Lisp process as an inferior of Emacs, and pass
expressions to it to be evaluated.  You can also pass changed function
definitions directly from the Emacs buffers in which you edit the Lisp
programs to the inferior Lisp process.

   To run an inferior Lisp process, type `M-x run-lisp'.  This runs the
program named `lisp', the same program you would run by typing `lisp'
as a shell command, with both input and output going through an Emacs
buffer named `*lisp*'.  That is to say, any "terminal output" from Lisp
will go into the buffer, advancing point, and any "terminal input" for
Lisp comes from text in the buffer.  (You can change the name of the
Lisp executable file by setting the variable `inferior-lisp-program'.)

   To give input to Lisp, go to the end of the buffer and type the
input, terminated by RET.  The `*lisp*' buffer is in Inferior Lisp
mode, which combines the special characteristics of Lisp mode and Shell
mode (*note Shell Mode::.).

   For the source files of programs to run in external Lisps, use Lisp
mode.  This mode can be selected with `M-x lisp-mode', and is used
automatically for files whose names end in `.l' or `.lisp', as most Lisp
systems usually expect.

   When you edit a function in a Lisp program you are running, the
easiest way to send the changed definition to the inferior Lisp process
is the key `C-M-x'.  In Lisp mode, this runs the function
`lisp-send-defun', which finds the defun around or following point and
sends it as input to the Lisp process.  (Emacs can send input to any
inferior process regardless of what buffer is current.)

   Contrast the meanings of `C-M-x' in Lisp mode (for editing programs
to be run in another Lisp system) and Emacs-Lisp mode (for editing Lisp
programs to be run in Emacs): in both modes it has the effect of
installing the function definition that point is in, but the way of
doing so is different according to where the relevant Lisp environment
is found.  *Note Executing Lisp::.

Abbrevs
*******

   An "abbrev" is a word which "expands", if you insert it, into some
different text.  Abbrevs are defined by the user to expand in specific
ways.  For example, you might define `foo' as an abbrev expanding to
`find outer otter'.  With this abbrev defined, you would be able to get
`find outer otter ' into the buffer by typing `f o o SPC'.

   Abbrevs expand only when Abbrev mode (a minor mode) is enabled.
Disabling Abbrev mode does not cause abbrev definitions to be forgotten,
but they do not expand until Abbrev mode is enabled again.  The command
`M-x abbrev-mode' toggles Abbrev mode; with a numeric argument, it
turns Abbrev mode on if the argument is positive, off otherwise.  *Note
Minor Modes::.  `abbrev-mode' is also a variable; Abbrev mode is on
when the variable is non-`nil'.  The variable `abbrev-mode'
automatically becomes local to the current buffer when it is set.

   Abbrev definitions can be "mode-specific"--active only in one major
mode.  Abbrevs can also have "global" definitions that are active in
all major modes.  The same abbrev can have a global definition and
various mode-specific definitions for different major modes.  A mode
specific definition for the current major mode overrides a global
definition.

   Abbrevs can be defined interactively during the editing session.
Lists of abbrev definitions can also be saved in files and reloaded in
later sessions.  Some users keep extensive lists of abbrevs that they
load in every session.

   A second kind of abbreviation facility is called the "dynamic
expansion".  Dynamic abbrev expansion happens only when you give an
explicit command and the result of the expansion depends only on the
current contents of the buffer.  *Note Dynamic Abbrevs::.

Defining Abbrevs
================

`C-x a g'
     Define an abbrev, using one or more words before point as its
     expansion (`add-global-abbrev').

`C-x a l'
     Similar, but define an abbrev specific to the current major mode
     (`add-mode-abbrev').

`C-x a i g'
     Define a word in the buffer as an abbrev
     (`inverse-add-global-abbrev').

`C-x a i l'
     Define a word in the buffer as a mode-specific abbrev
     (`inverse-add-mode-abbrev').

`M-x kill-all-abbrevs'
     After this command, there are no abbrev definitions in effect.

   The usual way to define an abbrev is to enter the text you want the
abbrev to expand to, position point after it, and type `C-x a g'
(`add-global-abbrev').  This reads the abbrev itself using the
minibuffer, and then defines it as an abbrev for one or more words
before point.  Use a numeric argument to say how many words before
point should be taken as the expansion.  For example, to define the
abbrev `foo' as mentioned above, insert the text `find outer otter' and
then type `C-u 3 C-x a g f o o RET'.

   An argument of zero to `C-x a g' means to use the contents of the
region as the expansion of the abbrev being defined.

   The command `C-x a l' (`add-mode-abbrev') is similar, but defines a
mode-specific abbrev.  Mode specific abbrevs are active only in a
particular major mode.  `C-x a l' defines an abbrev for the major mode
in effect at the time `C-x a l' is typed.  The arguments work the same
as for `C-x a g'.

   If the text of the abbrev you want is already in the buffer instead
of the expansion, use command `C-x a i g' (`inverse-add-global-abbrev')
instead of `C-x a g', or use `C-x a i l' (`inverse-add-mode-abbrev')
instead of `C-x a l'.  These commands are called "inverse" because they
invert the meaning of the argument found in the buffer and the argument
read using the minibuffer.

   To change the definition of an abbrev, just add the new definition.
You will be asked to confirm if the abbrev has a prior definition.  To
remove an abbrev definition, give a negative argument to `C-x a g' or
`C-x a l'.  You must choose the command to specify whether to kill a
global definition or a mode-specific definition for the current mode,
since those two definitions are independent for one abbrev.

   `M-x kill-all-abbrevs' removes all the abbrev definitions there are.

Controlling Abbrev Expansion
============================

   An abbrev expands whenever it is present in the buffer just before
point and a self-inserting punctuation character (SPC, comma, etc.) is
typed.  Most often the way an abbrev is used is to insert the abbrev
followed by punctuation.

   Abbrev expansion preserves case; thus, `foo' expands into `find
outer otter'; `Foo' into `Find outer otter', and `FOO' into `FIND OUTER
OTTER' or `Find Outer Otter' according to the variable
`abbrev-all-caps' (a non-`nil' value chooses the first of the two
expansions).

   These two commands are used to control abbrev expansion:

`M-''
     Separate a prefix from a following abbrev to be expanded
     (`abbrev-prefix-mark').

`C-x a e'
     Expand the abbrev before point (`expand-abbrev').  This is
     effective even when Abbrev mode is not enabled.

`M-x unexpand-abbrev'
     Undo last abbrev expansion.

`M-x expand-region-abbrevs'
     Expand some or all abbrevs found in the region.

   You may wish to expand an abbrev with a prefix attached; for
example, if `cnst' expands into `construction', you might want to use
it to enter `reconstruction'.  It does not work to type `recnst',
because that is not necessarily a defined abbrev.  What does work is to
use the command `M-'' (`abbrev-prefix-mark') in between the prefix `re'
and the abbrev `cnst'.  First, insert `re'.  Then type `M-''; this
inserts a minus sign in the buffer to indicate that it has done its
work.  Then insert the abbrev `cnst'; the buffer now contains
`re-cnst'.  Now insert a punctuation character to expand the abbrev
`cnst' into `construction'.  The minus sign is deleted at this point,
because `M-'' left word for this to be done.  The resulting text is the
desired `reconstruction'.

   If you actually want the text of the abbrev in the buffer, rather
than its expansion, you can accomplish this by inserting the following
punctuation with `C-q'.  Thus, `foo C-q -' leaves `foo-' in the buffer.

   If you expand an abbrev by mistake, you can undo the expansion
(replace the expansion by the original abbrev text) with `M-x
unexpand-abbrev'.  `C-_' (`undo') can also be used to undo the
expansion; but first it undoes the insertion of the following
punctuation character.  Therefore, if you want both the punctuation
character and the unexpanded abbrev, you must reinsert the punctuation
character, quoting it with `C-q'.

   `M-x expand-region-abbrevs' searches through the region for defined
abbrevs, and for each one found offers to replace it with its expansion.
This command is useful if you have typed in text using abbrevs but
forgot to turn on Abbrev mode first.  It may also be useful together
with a special set of abbrev definitions for making several global
replacements at once.  This command is effective even if Abbrev mode is
not enabled.

   Expanding an abbrev runs the hook `pre-abbrev-expand-hook' (*note
Hooks::.).

Examining and Editing Abbrevs
=============================

`M-x list-abbrevs'
     Print a list of all abbrev definitions.

`M-x edit-abbrevs'
     Edit a list of abbrevs; you can add, alter or remove definitions.

   The output from `M-x list-abbrevs' looks like this:

     (lisp-mode-abbrev-table)
     "dk"	       0    "define-key"
     (global-abbrev-table)
     "dfn"	       0    "definition"

(Some blank lines of no semantic significance, and some other abbrev
tables, have been omitted.)

   A line containing a name in parentheses is the header for abbrevs in
a particular abbrev table; `global-abbrev-table' contains all the global
abbrevs, and the other abbrev tables that are named after major modes
contain the mode-specific abbrevs.

   Within each abbrev table, each nonblank line defines one abbrev.  The
word at the beginning is the abbrev.  The number that appears is the
number of times the abbrev has been expanded.  Emacs keeps track of
this to help you see which abbrevs you actually use, in case you decide
to eliminate those that you don't use often.  The string at the end of
the line is the expansion.

   `M-x edit-abbrevs' allows you to add, change or kill abbrev
definitions by editing a list of them in an Emacs buffer.  The list has
the same format described above.  The buffer of abbrevs is called
`*Abbrevs*', and is in Edit-Abbrevs mode.  This mode redefines the key
`C-c C-c' to install the abbrev definitions as specified in the buffer.
The command that does this is `edit-abbrevs-redefine'.  Any abbrevs
not described in the buffer are eliminated when this is done.

   The command `edit-abbrevs' is actually the same as `list-abbrevs'
except that it selects the buffer `*Abbrevs*' whereas `list-abbrevs'
merely displays it in another window.

Saving Abbrevs
==============

   These commands allow you to keep abbrev definitions between editing
sessions.

`M-x write-abbrev-file'
     Write a file describing all defined abbrevs.

`M-x read-abbrev-file'
     Read such a file and define abbrevs as specified there.

`M-x quietly-read-abbrev-file'
     Similar but do not display a message about what is going on.

`M-x define-abbrevs'
     Define abbrevs from definitions in current buffer.

`M-x insert-abbrevs'
     Insert all abbrevs and their expansions into current buffer.

   `M-x write-abbrev-file' reads a file name using the minibuffer and
writes a description of all current abbrev definitions into that file.
The text stored in the file looks like the output of `M-x list-abbrevs'.
This is used to save abbrev definitions for use in a later session.

   `M-x read-abbrev-file' reads a file name using the minibuffer and
reads the file, defining abbrevs according to the contents of the file.
`M-x quietly-read-abbrev-file' is the same except that it does not
display a message in the echo area saying that it is doing its work; it
is actually useful primarily in the `.emacs' file.  If an empty
argument is given to either of these functions, the file name used is
the value of the variable `abbrev-file-name', which is by default
`"~/.abbrev_defs"'.

   Emacs will offer to save abbrevs automatically if you have changed
any of them, whenever it offers to save all files (for `C-x s' or `C-x
C-c').  This feature can be inhibited by setting the variable
`save-abbrevs' to `nil'.

   The commands `M-x insert-abbrevs' and `M-x define-abbrevs' are
similar to the previous commands but work on text in an Emacs buffer.
`M-x insert-abbrevs' inserts text into the current buffer before point,
describing all current abbrev definitions; `M-x define-abbrevs' parses
the entire current buffer and defines abbrevs accordingly.


File: emacs,  Node: Dynamic Abbrevs,  Prev: Saving Abbrevs,  Up: Abbrevs

Dynamic Abbrev Expansion
========================

   The abbrev facility described above operates automatically as you
insert text, but all abbrevs must be defined explicitly.  By contrast,
"dynamic abbrevs" allow the meanings of abbrevs to be determined
automatically from the contents of the buffer, but dynamic abbrev
expansion happens only when you request it explicitly.

`M-/'
     Expand the word in the buffer before point as a "dynamic abbrev",
     by searching in the buffer for words starting with that
     abbreviation (`dabbrev-expand').

   For example, if the buffer contains `does this follow ' and you type
`f o M-/', the effect is to insert `follow' because that is the last
word in the buffer that starts with `fo'.  A numeric argument to `M-/'
says to take the second, third, etc. distinct expansion found looking
backward from point.  Repeating `M-/' searches for an alternative
expansion by looking farther back.  After the entire buffer before
point has been considered, the buffer after point is searched.

   Dynamic abbrev expansion is completely independent of Abbrev mode;
the expansion of a word with `M-/' is completely independent of whether
it has a definition as an ordinary abbrev.

Editing Pictures
****************

   If you want to create a picture made out of text characters (for
example, a picture of the division of a register into fields, as a
comment in a program), use the command `M-x edit-picture' to enter
Picture mode.

   In Picture mode, editing is based on the "quarter-plane" model of
text, according to which the text characters lie studded on an area that
stretches infinitely far to the right and downward.  The concept of the
end of a line does not exist in this model; the most you can say is
where the last nonblank character on the line is found.

   Of course, Emacs really always considers text as a sequence of
characters, and lines really do have ends.  But in Picture mode most
frequently-used keys are rebound to commands that simulate the
quarter-plane model of text.  They do this by inserting spaces or by
converting tabs to spaces.

   Most of the basic editing commands of Emacs are redefined by Picture
mode to do essentially the same thing but in a quarter-plane way.  In
addition, Picture mode defines various keys starting with the `C-c'
prefix to run special picture editing commands.

   One of these keys, `C-c C-c', is pretty important.  Often a picture
is part of a larger file that is usually edited in some other major
mode.  `M-x edit-picture' records the name of the previous major mode
so you can use the `C-c C-c' command (`picture-mode-exit') later to go
back to that mode.  `C-c C-c' also deletes spaces from the ends of
lines, unless given a numeric argument.

   The commands used in Picture mode all work in other modes (provided
the `picture' library is loaded), but are not bound to keys except in
Picture mode.  Note that the descriptions below talk of moving "one
column" and so on, but all the picture mode commands handle numeric
arguments as their normal equivalents do.

   Turning on Picture mode runs the hook `picture-mode-hook' (*note
Hooks::.).

* Menu:

* Basic Picture::         Basic concepts and simple commands of Picture Mode.
* Insert in Picture::     Controlling direction of cursor motion
                            after "self-inserting" characters.

* Rectangles in Picture:: Clearing and superimposing rectangles.

Basic Editing in Picture Mode
=============================

   Most keys do the same thing in Picture mode that they usually do, but
do it in a quarter-plane style.  For example, `C-f' is rebound to run
`picture-forward-column', a command which moves point one column to the
right, inserting a space if necessary so that the actual end of the
line makes no difference.  `C-b' is rebound to run
`picture-backward-column', which always moves point left one column,
converting a tab to multiple spaces if necessary.  `C-n' and `C-p' are
rebound to run `picture-move-down' and `picture-move-up', which can
either insert spaces or convert tabs as necessary to make sure that
point stays in exactly the same column.  `C-e' runs
`picture-end-of-line', which moves to after the last nonblank character
on the line.  There is no need to change `C-a', as the choice of screen
model does not affect beginnings of lines.

   Insertion of text is adapted to the quarter-plane screen model
through the use of Overwrite mode (*note Minor Modes::.).
Self-inserting characters replace existing text, column by column,
rather than pushing existing text to the right.  RET runs
`picture-newline', which just moves to the beginning of the following
line so that new text will replace that line.

   Picture mode provides erasure instead of deletion and killing of
text.  DEL (`picture-backward-clear-column') replaces the preceding
character with a space rather than removing it; this moves point
backwards.  `C-d' (`picture-clear-column') replaces the next character
or characters with spaces, but does not move point.  (If you want to
clear characters to spaces and move forward over them, use SPC.)  `C-k'
(`picture-clear-line') really kills the contents of lines, but does not
delete the newlines from the buffer.

   To do actual insertion, you must use special commands.  `C-o'
(`picture-open-line') still creates a blank line, but does so after the
current line; it never splits a line.  `C-M-o', `split-line', makes
sense in Picture mode, so it is not changed.  LFD
(`picture-duplicate-line') inserts below the current line another line
with the same contents.

   If you want to do real deletion in Picture mode, use `C-w', `C-c
C-d' (which is defined as `delete-char', as `C-d' is in other modes),
or one of the picture rectangle commands (*note Rectangles in
Picture::.).

Controlling Motion after Insert
===============================

   Since "self-inserting" characters in Picture mode just overwrite and
move point, there is no essential restriction on how point should be
moved.  Normally point moves right, but you can specify any of the
eight orthogonal or diagonal directions for motion after a
"self-inserting" character.  This is useful for drawing lines in the
buffer.

`C-c <'
     Move left after insertion (`picture-movement-left').

`C-c >'
     Move right after insertion (`picture-movement-right').

`C-c ^'
     Move up after insertion (`picture-movement-up').

`C-c .'
     Move down after insertion (`picture-movement-down').

`C-c `'
     Move up and left ("northwest") after insertion
     (`picture-movement-nw').

`C-c ''
     Move up and right ("northeast") after insertion
     (`picture-movement-ne').

`C-c /'
     Move down and left ("southwest") after insertion
     (`picture-movement-sw').

`C-c \'
     Move down and right ("southeast") after insertion
     (`picture-movement-se').

   Two motion commands move based on the current Picture insertion
direction.  The command `C-c C-f' (`picture-motion') moves in the same
direction as motion after "insertion" currently does, while `C-c C-b'
(`picture-motion-reverse') moves in the opposite direction.


File: emacs,  Node: Tabs in Picture,  Next: Rectangles in Picture,  Prev: Insert in Picture,  Up: Picture

Picture Mode Tabs
=================

   Two kinds of tab-like action are provided in Picture mode.  Use
`M-TAB' (`picture-tab-search') for context-based tabbing.  With no
argument, it moves to a point underneath the next "interesting"
character that follows whitespace in the previous nonblank line.
"Next" here means "appearing at a horizontal position greater than the
one point starts out at".  With an argument, as in `C-u M-TAB', this
command moves to the next such interesting character in the current
line.  `M-TAB' does not change the text; it only moves point.
"Interesting" characters are defined by the variable
`picture-tab-chars', which contains a string whose characters are all
considered interesting.  Its default value is `"!-~"'.

   TAB itself runs `picture-tab', which operates based on the current
tab stop settings; it is the Picture mode equivalent of
`tab-to-tab-stop'.  Normally it just moves point, but with a numeric
argument it clears the text that it moves over.

   The context-based and tab-stop-based forms of tabbing are brought
together by the command `C-c TAB', `picture-set-tab-stops'.  This
command sets the tab stops to the positions which `M-TAB' would
consider significant in the current line.  The use of this command,
together with TAB, can get the effect of context-based tabbing.  But
`M-TAB' is more convenient in the cases where it is sufficient.


File: emacs,  Node: Rectangles in Picture,  Prev: Tabs in Picture,  Up: Picture

Picture Mode Rectangle Commands
===============================

   Picture mode defines commands for working on rectangular pieces of
the text in ways that fit with the quarter-plane model.  The standard
rectangle commands may also be useful (*note Rectangles::.).

`C-c C-k'
     Clear out the region-rectangle (`picture-clear-rectangle').  With
     argument, kill it.

`C-c C-w R'
     Similar but save rectangle contents in register R first
     (`picture-clear-rectangle-to-register').

`C-c C-y'
     Copy last killed rectangle into the buffer by overwriting, with
     upper left corner at point (`picture-yank-rectangle').  With
     argument, insert instead.

`C-c C-x R'
     Similar, but use the rectangle in register R
     (`picture-yank-rectangle-from-register').

   The picture rectangle commands `C-c C-k' (`picture-clear-rectangle')
and `C-c C-w' (`picture-clear-rectangle-to-register') differ from the
standard rectangle commands in that they normally clear the rectangle
instead of deleting it; this is analogous with the way `C-d' is changed
in Picture mode.

   However, deletion of rectangles can be useful in Picture mode, so
these commands delete the rectangle if given a numeric argument.

   The Picture mode commands for yanking rectangles differ from the
standard ones in overwriting instead of inserting.  This is the same way
that Picture mode insertion of other text differs from other modes.
`C-c C-y' (`picture-yank-rectangle') inserts (by overwriting) the
rectangle that was most recently killed, while `C-c C-x'
(`picture-yank-rectangle-from-register') does likewise for the
rectangle found in a specified register.

Sending Mail
************

   To send a message in Emacs, you start by typing a command (`C-x m')
to select and initialize the `*mail*' buffer.  Then you edit the text
and headers of the message in this buffer, and type another command
(`C-c C-c') to send the message.

`C-x m'
     Begin composing a message to send (`mail').

`C-x 4 m'
     Likewise, but display the message in another window
     (`mail-other-window').

`C-x 5 m'
     Likewise, but make a new frame (`mail-other-frame').

`C-c C-c'
     In Mail mode, send the message and switch to another buffer
     (`mail-send-and-exit').

   The command `C-x m' (`mail') selects a buffer named `*mail*' and
initializes it with the skeleton of an outgoing message.  `C-x 4 m'
(`mail-other-window') selects the `*mail*' buffer in a different
window, leaving the previous current buffer visible.  `C-x 5 m'
(`mail-other-frame') creates a new frame to select the `*mail*' buffer.

   Because the mail composition buffer is an ordinary Emacs buffer, you
can switch to other buffers while in the middle of composing mail, and
switch back later (or never).  If you use the `C-x m' command again
when you have been composing another message but have not sent it, you
are asked to confirm before the old message is erased.  If you answer
`n', the `*mail*' buffer is left selected with its old contents, so you
can finish the old message and send it.  `C-u C-x m' is another way to
do this.  Sending the message marks the `*mail*' buffer "unmodified",
which avoids the need for confirmation when `C-x m' is next used.

   If you are composing a message in the `*mail*' buffer and want to
send another message before finishing the first, rename the `*mail*'
buffer using `M-x rename-uniquely' (*note Misc Buffer::.).  Then you
can use `C-x m' or its variants described above to make a new `*mail'
buffer.  Once you've done that, you can work with each mail buffer
independently.

File: emacs,  Node: Mail Format,  Next: Mail Headers,  Up: Sending Mail

The Format of the Mail Buffer
=============================

   In addition to the "text" or "body", a message has "header fields"
which say who sent it, when, to whom, why, and so on.  Some header
fields such as the date and sender are created automatically after the
message is sent.  Others, such as the recipient names, must be
specified by you in order to send the message properly.

   Mail mode provides a few commands to help you edit some header
fields, and some are preinitialized in the buffer automatically at
times.  You can insert or edit any header fields using ordinary editing
commands.

   The line in the buffer that says

     --text follows this line--

is a special delimiter that separates the headers you have specified
from the text.  Whatever follows this line is the text of the message;
the headers precede it.  The delimiter line itself does not appear in
the message actually sent.  The text used for the delimiter line is
controlled by the variable `mail-header-separator'.

   Here is an example of what the headers and text in the `*mail*'
buffer might look like.

Mail Header Fields
==================

   There are several header fields you can use in the `*mail*' buffer.
Each header field starts with a field name at the beginning of a line,
terminated by a colon.  Upper and lower case are equivalent in field
names (and in mailing addresses also).  After the colon and optional
whitespace comes the contents of the field.

`To'
     This field contains the mailing addresses to which the message is
     addressed.

`Subject'
     The contents of the `Subject' field should be a piece of text that
     says what the message is about.  The reason `Subject' fields are
     useful is that most mail-reading programs can provide a summary of
     messages, listing the subject of each message but not its text.

`CC'
     This field contains additional mailing addresses to send the
     message to, but whose readers should not regard the message as
     addressed to them.

`BCC'
     This field contains additional mailing addresses to send the
     message to, which should not appear in the header of the message
     actually sent.  Copies sent this way are called "blind carbon
     copies".

     To send a blind carbon copy of every outgoing message to yourself,
     set the variable `mail-self-blind' to `t'.

`FCC'
     This field contains the name of one file (in system mail file
     format) to which a copy of the message should be appended when the
     message is sent.  Do not output directly into an Rmail file with
     FCC; instead, output to an inbox file and "get new mail" from that
     inbox file into the Rmail file.  *Note Rmail Inbox::.

`From'
     Use the `From' field to say who you are, when the account you are
     using to send the mail is not your own.  The contents of the
     `From' field should be a valid mailing address, since replies will
     normally go there.

`Reply-to'
     Use this field to direct replies to a different address.  Most
     mail-reading programs (including Rmail) automatically send replies
     to the `Reply-to' address in preference to the `From' address.  By
     adding a `Reply-to' field to your header, you can work around any
     problems your `From' address may cause for replies.

     If you want to put the same `Reply-to' address into every outgoing
     message, set the variable `mail-default-reply-to' to that address
     (as a string).

`In-reply-to'
     This field contains a piece of text describing a message you are
     replying to.  Some mail systems can use this information to
     correlate related pieces of mail.  Normally this field is filled
     in by Rmail when you are replying to a message in Rmail, and you
     never need to think about it (*note Rmail::.).

The `To', `CC', `BCC' and `FCC' fields can appear any number of times,
to specify many places to send the message.

The `To', `CC', and `BCC' fields can have continuation lines.  All the
lines starting with whitespace, following the line on which the field
starts, are considered part of the field.  For example,

     To: foo@here.net, this@there.net,
       me@gnu.cambridge.mass.usa.earth.spiral3281

   If the variable `mail-archive-file-name' is non-`nil', it should be
a string naming a file; every time you start to edit a message to send,
the message starts out with an `FCC' field specifying that file.
Unless you remove the `FCC' field before sending, the message will be
written into that file when it is sent.

Mail Aliases
============

   You can define "mail aliases" in a file named `~/.mailrc'.  These
are short mnemonic names stand for mail addresses or groups of mail
addresses.  Like many other mail programs, Emacs expands aliases when
they occur in the `To', `CC', and `BCC' fields.

   To define an alias in `~/.mailrc', write a line in the following
format:

     alias SHORTADDRESS FULLADDRESS

For instance, if you send want to use `maingnu' as a short form of the
address `gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu', put in the line:

     alias maingnu gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu

The file `~/.mailrc' is used primarily by other mail-reading programs;
it can contain various other commands.  Emacs ignores everything in it
except for alias definitions.

   Another way to define a mail alias, within Emacs alone, is with the
`define-mail-alias' command.  It prompts for the alias and then the
full address.  You can use it to define aliases in your `.emacs' file,
like this:

     (define-mail-alias "maingnu" "gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu")

   `define-mail-alias' records aliases by adding them to a variable
named `mail-aliases'.  If your are comfortable with manipulating Lisp
lists, you can set `mail-aliases' directly.  The initial value of
`mail-aliases' is `t', which means that Emacs should read `.mailrc' to
get the proper value.

   Normally, Emacs expands aliases when you send the message.  If you
like, you can have mail aliases expand as abbrevs, as soon as you type
them in.  To enable this feature, execute the following:

     (add-hook 'mail-setup-hook 'mail-abbrevs-setup)

This can go in your `.emacs' file.  *Note Hooks::.  If you use this
feature, you must use `define-mail-abbrev' instead of
`define-mail-alias'; the latter does not work with this package.  Also,
the mail abbreviation package uses the variable `mail-abbrevs' instead
of `mail-aliases'.

   Note that abbrevs expand only if you insert a word-separator
character afterward.  However, any mail aliases that you didn't expand
in the mail buffer are expanded subsequently when you send the message.
*Note Abbrevs::.

Mail Mode
=========

   The major mode used in the `*mail*' buffer is Mail mode, which is
much like Text mode except that various special commands are provided on
the `C-c' prefix.  These commands all have to do specifically with
editing or sending the message.

`C-c C-s'
     Send the message, and leave the `*mail*' buffer selected
     (`mail-send').

`C-c C-c'
     Send the message, and select some other buffer
     (`mail-send-and-exit').

`C-c C-f C-t'
     Move to the `To' header field, creating one if there is none
     (`mail-to').

`C-c C-f C-s'
     Move to the `Subject' header field, creating one if there is none
     (`mail-subject').

`C-c C-f C-c'
     Move to the `CC' header field, creating one if there is none
     (`mail-cc').

`C-c C-w'
     Insert the file `~/.signature' at the end of the message text
     (`mail-signature').

`C-c C-y'
     Yank the selected message from Rmail (`mail-yank-original').  This
     command does nothing unless your command to start sending a
     message was issued with Rmail.

`C-c C-q'
     Fill all paragraphs of yanked old messages, each individually
     (`mail-fill-yanked-message').

   There are two ways to send the message.  `C-c C-s' (`mail-send')
sends the message and marks the `*mail*' buffer unmodified, but leaves
that buffer selected so that you can modify the message (perhaps with
new recipients) and send it again.  `C-c C-c' (`mail-send-and-exit')
sends and then deletes the window or switches to another buffer.  It
puts the `*mail*' buffer at the lowest priority for reselection by
default, since you are finished with using it.  This is the usual way
to send the message.

   Mail mode provides some other special commands that are useful for
editing the headers and text of the message before you send it.  There
are three commands defined to move point to particular header fields,
all based on the prefix `C-c C-f' (`C-f' is for "field").  They are
`C-c C-f C-t' (`mail-to') to move to the `To' field, `C-c C-f C-s'
(`mail-subject') for the `Subject' field, and `C-c C-f C-c' (`mail-cc')
for the `CC' field.  These fields have special motion commands because
they are the most common fields for the user to want to edit.

   `C-c C-w' (`mail-signature') adds a standard piece text at the end
of the message to say more about who you are.  The text comes from the
file `.signature' in your home directory.

   To insert signatures automatically, set the variable
`mail-signature' non-`nil'; then starting a mail message automatically
inserts the contents of your `.signature' file.  If you want to omit
your signature from a particular message, delete it from the buffer
before you send the message.

   When mail sending is invoked from the Rmail mail reader using an
Rmail command, `C-c C-y' can be used inside the `*mail*' buffer to
insert the text of the message you are replying to.  Normally it
indents each line of that message four spaces and eliminates most
header fields.  A numeric argument specifies the number of spaces to
indent.  An argument of just `C-u' says not to indent at all and not to
eliminate anything.  `C-c C-y' always uses the current message from the
`RMAIL' buffer, so you can insert several old messages by selecting one
in `RMAIL', switching to `*mail*' and yanking it, then switching back to
`RMAIL' to select another.

   You can specify the text for `C-c C-y' to insert at the beginning of
each line: set `mail-yank-prefix' to the desired string.  (A value of
`nil' means to use indentation; this is the default.) However, `C-u C-c
C-y' never adds anything at the beginning of the inserted lines,
regardless of the value of `mail-yank-prefix'.

   After using `C-c C-y', you can use the command `C-c C-q'
(`mail-fill-yanked-message') to fill the paragraphs of the yanked old
message or messages.  One use of `C-c C-q' fills all such paragraphs,
each one individually.

   Mail mode defines the character `%' as part of a word; this is
helpful for using the word commands to edit mail addresses.

   Turning on Mail mode (which `C-x m' does automatically) runs the
normal hooks `text-mode-hook' and `mail-mode-hook'.  Initializing a new
outgoing message runs the normal hook `mail-setup-hook'; if you want to
add special fields to your mail header or make other changes to the
appearance of the mail buffer, use that hook.  *Note Hooks::.

   The main difference between these hooks is just when they are
invoked.  Whenever you type `M-x mail', `mail-mode-hook' runs as soon
as the `*mail*' buffer is created.  Then the `mail-setup' function puts
in the default contents of the buffer.  After these default contents
are inserted, `mail-setup-hook' runs.

Distracting the NSA
===================

   `M-x spook' adds a line of randomly chosen keywords to an outgoing
mail message.  The keywords are chosen from a list of words that suggest
you are discussing something subversive.

   The idea behind this feature is that the suspicion that the NSA
snoops on all electronic mail messages that contain keywords suggesting
they might be interested.  (The NSA says they don't, but there is no
way to be certain.)  The idea is that if lots of people add suspicious
words to their messages, the NSA will get so busy with spurious input
that they will have to give up reading it all.

   Whether or not this confuses the NSA, it at least amuses people.

Reading Mail with Rmail
***********************

   Rmail is an Emacs subsystem for reading and disposing of mail that
you receive.  Rmail stores mail messages in files called Rmail files.
Reading the message in an Rmail file is done in a special major mode,
Rmail mode, which redefines most letters to run commands for managing
mail.  To enter Rmail, type `M-x rmail'.  This reads your primary mail
file, merges new mail in from your inboxes, displays the first message
you haven't read yet, and lets you begin reading.

   Using Rmail in the simplest fashion, you have one Rmail file
`~/RMAIL' in which all of your mail is saved.  It is called your
"primary mail file".  In more sophisticated usage, you can copy
messages into other Rmail files and then edit those files with Rmail.

   Rmail uses narrowing to hide all but one message in the Rmail file.
The message that is shown is called the "current message".  Rmail
mode's special commands can do such things as delete the current
message, copy into another file, send a reply, or move to another
message.

   Within the Rmail file, messages are arranged sequentially in order
of receipt.  They are also assigned consecutive integers as their
"message numbers".  The number of the current message is displayed in
Rmail's mode line, followed by the total number of messages in the
file.  You can move to a message by specifying its message number using
the `j' key (*note Rmail Motion::.).

   Following the usual conventions of Emacs, changes in an Rmail file
become permanent only when the file is saved.  You can do this with `s'
(`rmail-save'), which also expunges deleted messages from the file
first (*note Rmail Deletion::.).  To save the file without expunging,
use `C-x C-s'.  Rmail saves the Rmail file spontaneously when moving new
mail from an inbox file (*note Rmail Inbox::.).

   You can exit Rmail with `q' (`rmail-quit'); this expunges and saves
the Rmail file and then switches to another buffer.  But there is no
need to `exit' formally.  If you switch from Rmail to editing in other
buffers, and never happen to switch back, you have exited.  (The Rmail
command `b', `rmail-bury', does this for you.)  Just make sure to save
the Rmail file eventually (like any other file you have changed).  `C-x
s' is a good enough way to do this (*note Saving::.).

Scrolling Within a Message
==========================

   When Rmail displays a message that does not fit on the screen, it is
necessary to scroll through it.  This could be done with `C-v', `M-v'
and `M-<', but in Rmail scrolling is so frequent that it deserves to be
easier to type.

`SPC'
     Scroll forward (`scroll-up').

`DEL'
     Scroll backward (`scroll-down').

`.'
     Scroll to start of message (`rmail-beginning-of-message').

   Since the most common thing to do while reading a message is to
scroll through it by screenfuls, Rmail makes SPC and DEL synonyms of
`C-v' (`scroll-up') and `M-v' (`scroll-down')

   The command `.' (`rmail-beginning-of-message') scrolls back to the
beginning of the selected message.  This is not quite the same as `M-<':
for one thing, it does not set the mark; for another, it resets the
buffer boundaries to the current message if you have changed them.


File: emacs,  Node: Rmail Motion,  Next: Rmail Deletion,  Prev: Rmail Scrolling,  Up: Rmail

Moving Among Messages
=====================

   The most basic thing to do with a message is to read it.  The way to
do this in Rmail is to make the message current.  The usual practice is
to move sequentially through the file, since this is the order of
receipt of messages.  When you enter Rmail, you are positioned at the
first message that you have not yet made current (that is, the first one
that has the `unseen' attribute; *note Rmail Labels::.).  Move forward
to see the other new messages; move backward to reexamine old messages.

`n'
     Move to the next nondeleted message, skipping any intervening
     deleted
     messages (`rmail-next-undeleted-message').

`p'
     Move to the previous nondeleted message
     (`rmail-previous-undeleted-message').

`M-n'
     Move to the next message, including deleted messages
     (`rmail-next-message').

`M-p'
     Move to the previous message, including deleted messages
     (`rmail-previous-message').

`j'
     Move to the first message.  With argument N, move to message
     number N (`rmail-show-message').

`>'
     Move to the last message (`rmail-last-message').

`<'
     Move to the first message (`rmail-first-message').

`M-s REGEXP RET'
     Move to the next message containing a match for REGEXP
     (`rmail-search').

`- M-s REGEXP RET'
     Move to the previous message containing a match for REGEXP.

   `n' and `p' are the usual way of moving among messages in Rmail.
They move through the messages sequentially, but skip over deleted
messages, which is usually what you want to do.  Their command
definitions are named `rmail-next-undeleted-message' and
`rmail-previous-undeleted-message'.  If you do not want to skip deleted
messages--for example, if you want to move to a message to undelete
it--use the variants `M-n' and `M-p' (`rmail-next-message' and
`rmail-previous-message').  A numeric argument to any of these commands
serves as a repeat count.

   In Rmail, you can specify a numeric argument by typing just the
digits.  You don't need to type `C-u' first.

   The `M-s' (`rmail-search') command is Rmail's version of search.
The usual incremental search command `C-s' works in Rmail, but it
searches only within the current message.  The purpose of `M-s' is to
search for another message.  It reads a regular expression (*note
Regexps::.) nonincrementally, then searches starting at the beginning
of the following message for a match.  The message containing the match
is selected.

   If REGEXP is empty, `M-s' reuses the regexp used the previous time.

   To search backward in the file for another message, give `M-s' a
negative argument.  In Rmail you can do this with `- M-s'.

   It is also possible to search for a message based on labels.  *Note
Rmail Labels::.

   To move to a message specified by absolute message number, use `j'
(`rmail-show-message') with the message number as argument.  With no
argument, `j' selects the first message.  `>' (`rmail-last-message')
selects the last message.  `<' (`rmail-first-message') selects the
first message.

Deleting Messages
=================

   When you no longer need to keep a message, you can "delete" it.  This
flags it as ignorable, and some Rmail commands pretend it is no longer
present; but it still has its place in the Rmail file, and still has its
message number.

   "Expunging" the Rmail file actually removes the deleted messages.
The remaining messages are renumbered consecutively.  Expunging is the
only action that changes the message number of any message, except for
undigestifying (*note Rmail Digest::.).

`d'
     Delete the current message, and move to the next nondeleted message
     (`rmail-delete-forward').

`C-d'
     Delete the current message, and move to the previous nondeleted
     message (`rmail-delete-backward').

`u'
     Undelete the current message, or move back to a deleted message and
     undelete it (`rmail-undelete-previous-message').

`x'
     Expunge the Rmail file (`rmail-expunge').

   There are two Rmail commands for deleting messages.  Both delete the
current message and select another message.  `d'
(`rmail-delete-forward') moves to the following message, skipping
messages already deleted, while `C-d' (`rmail-delete-backward') moves
to the previous nondeleted message.  If there is no nondeleted message
to move to in the specified direction, the message that was just
deleted remains current.

   To make all the deleted messages finally vanish from the Rmail file,
type `x' (`rmail-expunge').  Until you do this, you can still
"undelete" the deleted messages.

   To undelete, type `u' (`rmail-undelete-previous-message'), which is
designed to cancel the effect of a `d' command (usually).  It undeletes
the current message if the current message is deleted.  Otherwise it
moves backward to previous messages until a deleted message is found,
and undeletes that message.

   You can usually undo a `d' with a `u' because the `u' moves back to
and undeletes the message that the `d' deleted.  But this does not work
when the `d' skips a few already-deleted messages that follow the
message being deleted; then the `u' command undeletes the last of the
messages that were skipped.  There is no clean way to avoid this
problem.  However, by repeating the `u' command, you can eventually get
back to the message that you intend to undelete.  You can also select a
particular deleted message with `M-p' command, then type `u' to
undelete it.

   A deleted message has the `deleted' attribute, and as a result
`deleted' appears in the mode line when the current message is deleted.
In fact, deleting or undeleting a message is nothing more than adding
or removing this attribute.  *Note Rmail Labels::.
