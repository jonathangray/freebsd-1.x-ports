----------------------

E	everybody and their sibling wants "map", "map!", and "abb".
	there is now fledgling support for this, courtesy Otto Lind.
	Still no map! or abb, and nested maps are broken in a couple
	of ways, but it's a start...  oh yes, one other thing -- :map
	currently only supports single key mappings (i.e.  you can map one
	vile key-sequnce to a string, but there is no string to string
	mapping).

	    [ a user writes: vi's map/map!  has problems in treating
	    numbers of ^V in different platforms.  And mail/newsreaders
	    don't like those control characters.  I suggest you consider
	    the bindkey style in tcsh that uses \e as ESC, \r as return
	    etc.  vile is not just a vi emulator anyway. ]

E	add "set autowrite", ":n file" (what does that do?), "set noredraw"

E	now that paragraphs, sections, and sentences are all selectable
	with regexps, they (and the tabstop value) are prime candidates for
	moving into a "mode-values" set of values.  A buffer would inherit
	either the global normal-mode values, or the global c-mode values.

E	:k, to set a mark, won't work as ":ka" or ":kb".  Must use ":k a"

E	patterns as addresses do not work, e.g. ":/str1/,/str2/d".  They're
	hard to parse the way things are set up right now.  We could accumulate
	the whole commandline, and then parse it, the way real vi does, but we'd
	lose the "prompt and display last response" behavior.

E	should add an option to support file locking, rather than the current
	ifdef stuff.  (this is only useful if we match the GNU locking
	protocol.) And it's not clear that in an NFS'ed environment that
	it's all that easy to get that style of locking right anyway.

E	the scrsearch functions could become region based -- as in "search for
	the next occurrence of the region", which would usually be a word.  And
	the ^A/ version could become "a/ (search for the contents of buffer a),
	if you know what I mean.

E	g should become a region command.  Then it could take ranges, as
	it should, and could also become an operator command.

E	adjust window size of popups based on length of buffer.  currently
	popups get half the window they're splitting, no matter what

E	collapse command execution code to as few places as possible.
	Its currently spread through execute(), operator(),
	docmd(), and usekreg().

E	mlreply line should ideally be a one line buffer, so inline editing
	can be done on it.

E	I haven't even come close to testing vile for
	memory-full conditions.  Some malloc() packages give 95%
	warnings -- perhaps something like that should be done for
	safety.

E	marks should perhaps be linked onto lines.  this would make a lot
        of things a lot easier, since a mark would travel with the
        line, instead of having to be moved when the line is
        reallocated etc.  the U line could be treated as a special
        mark.  The "copied" flag needed by undo could be a special
        sort of mark as well.  Implementation of the "tag stack"
	would be aided by this as well.

E	:e and :n should be able to deal with multiple filenames resulting
	from filename globbing.  vi has this problem too.  At least
	vile lets you choose to choose the first such name.  it should show
	you the first name, so you know whether to accept it or not.

E	When a line is too long to fit on the screen, you have to move
	over it to see the rest, and when you get to the edge of the screen,
	it jumps. I would prefer a smooth(er) scroll.

L	vile really ought to use unix-crypt if it is available.

E	in autoindent mode: 0^D and ^^D don't work

E	can't search for a NUL in a buffer.

E	if a file has zero-length, it is treated as not-modified

E	":e" and ":e!" should share the same prompt data, which should be
	editable / history.  They both should default (like vi!) to the
	current buffer.

E	the "ww" command (e.g., 'writeall()') emits multiple messages via
	'mlforce()'; these go by too quickly to follow.
	[ the alternative currently is to require a press-return, which some
	  folks don't like. ]

E	for consistency, 'execute-macro-nn' should be 'execute-macro nn';
	doing this would allow modification to eliminate a fixed number of
	macro-buffers.

E	should ifdef the 'autobuffer' code for users who do not need vi-style
	buffering.

===================================================

    Is it possible to get vile to prompt you if you try to exit without
    viewing all the files that were given on the command line?

    It would be nice if the cmode-style autoindenting would do the
    same thing with () and [] as it does with {}.  This would be
    useful for writing function calls with lots of arguments.
[ hard ]

    In cmode, is it possible to get vile to return to the previous
    indentation on the line after a # directive?


===================================================

    The ed 'transfer' and 'move' commands don't work.
    (to copy and move text around.  e.g., :'a,'bt$.)

PCVILE

	- some function keys return 8 bit characters on the PC.  This means
	the input path, through tgetc, has to be 8-bit clean, we need to
	allow 256 bindings instead of the current 128, and we can't use
	0x80 as the definition of the SPEC bit.  All this is easy -- it
	just needs to be done.

===================================================

PCVILE

Firstly - UNISYS 80286, EGA screen, 4DOS command shell & NNANSI.SYS

1) Attempting to shell out to 4dos results in running COMMAND.COM.  Is
   this because COMSPEC is not checked ?

2) Attempting to redirect the output of a 4DOS internal command into a
   buffer works erratically.

	a) :e !dir		- never works
	b) ^X-!dir		- works BUT when followed by;
	   ^X-!set		- I get the dir listing again.


3) During testing I noticed another odd result when running the command;

	:!set

   I notice that the output starts on the status line and will overwrite
   it before continuing onto other lines.  However running

	:!dir

   appears to print out just fine.

4) Points 1) & 3) I have previuosly raised with Peter Ruczynski on his
   version.

[ i don't know if any of these are still true -- this was with 3.25 ]

Though I use it, I'm still not quite satisfied with the qident stuff.  It
needs to be more flexible.  That is, I'd like to make it user defined.
For example
	find-tag $qidentifier
should be expressable as a character class like
	find-tag &anyof "a-zA-Z_0-9:"
in a macro.  Or even more generally, as a regular expression:
	find-tag &scan "[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9:]\\*"
A leading ^ would root the search at the current cursor position.
Absence of a leading ^ would start at the current cursor position but would
scan ahead until it found a match.  That way I can redefine ^] to pick
up the next word even if the cursor is before the start of the word (thus
better mimicking vi's behavior).

[ This can almost be done with the $match variable, e.g.
	7 store-macro
		search-forward "[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9:]*"
		find-tag $match
	~endm

	bind-key execute-macro-7 ^A-g

The only remaining pieces of oddness I've seen are
1) doing ?\w when already on a \w character -- it says Only one occurrence
of pattern.

1a) doing ?\W when already on a \W character -- it says Only one occurrence
of pattern.

2) doing /\s stops at the end of a line and won't go any further (because
the cursor rests on the last character of the line which is before the eol).

[ these are both tricky to fix... i tried, and started introducing problems
elsewhere. -pgf]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, I encountered the following problem: I am editing foo.tex and
call latex using ^X!latex foo.tex. There is an error, so latex waits for
input -> vile sits waiting and nothing helps. I think this should
be interruptable. I will agree with you that the ^X! command was not
intended for this, but still...

But ok, the real problem is that after I kill latex and
vile comes back to life I can no longer filter parts of text using
!fmt. The text just gets deleted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I just grabbed a copy of xvi.  I noted some interesting tidbits while
reading the "differences between vi and xvi" document.  Some of these would
be nice in vile.


     As well as the normal named (conjugate) buffers, and the  default
     one  named @, several extra buffers named :, /, ?  and ! contain
     the last command lines entered for each of the command types.  So
     for  instance,  @: will re-execute the last colon command, or you
     can insert it into your buffer, edit it and  then re-execute  it
     (e.g. with dd@@).


     +    In insert and replace modes, ^A has the same meaning  as  ^@
          in  vi,  except  that it works at any time, not just for the
          first character.  Also, typing ^Bx, where x is the name of a
          conjugate  buffer,  inserts the contents of that buffer into
          the input stream at that point.  The buffer named  <  always
          contains the last thing inserted, so that ^B< is the same as
          ^A.


     2.8.  Preserve

     Rather than use vi's UNIX-specific method for  preservation,  xvi
     does  periodic  preservation  of all files currently being edited
     into a temporary file in the same directory.   Xvi  tries  to  do
     this  when you are not typing, so that you won't notice the short
     delay when the temporary file is written  out.   Obviously,  only
     changed  files  are preserved in this way, and the temporary file
     is normally removed once the  real  file  has  been  successfully
     written.   As  an  additional  safety  measure,  when  a  file is
     explicitly saved and  it  appears  not  to  have  been  preserved
     recently,  it  is  normally  preserved first.  This ensures that,
     even if the operating system crashes while the real file is being
     created, there should always be at least one recent copy of it in
     the filesystem.  The :preserve command is available as in  vi  to
     preserve a specific buffer manually.

     The level of safety provided by the preservation facility may  be
     configured   by   changing   the   values  of  the  preserve  and
     preservetime parameters.  The following values are available  for
     preserve:

     unsafe    Never preserve any  buffer  before  an  explicit  save.
               This  can  be useful on old, slow, floppy-only systems,
               but is not generally recommended.

     standard  The default value.  Only preserve a  buffer  before  an
               explicit  save if it appears not to have been preserved
               recently.

     safe      Always preserve buffers before they are written.

     paranoid  As for safe, but the preserve file  is  never  removed,
               even after the file has been successfully written.

     In all cases, all modified buffers  are  preserved  automatically
     after no user events have been received for preservetime seconds,
     if a minimum number of events (currently 60) have  been  received
     since  the  last  automatic  preservation.  This behaviour can be
     more or less disabled by setting  preservetime  to  a  very  high
     value.


------------------------
I wish ^X-!  could execute shell commands async'ly, i.e.  I should not have
to wait/do nothing while waiting for the ouput of compiling.  I should be
able to edit stuff in other buffers or even ^X-^X to edit src codes
while compilation is still going on.

------------
similar to above -- sub-commands run from ^X-! or ":[erw] !cmd" should be
"interactive" to the extent that user's input should be sent to the cmd
at least on a line-by-line basis (i.e. we can't send raw keystrokes -- we
have to do canonical processing.  of course, we should really use pty's, and
reconnect input and capture output.)  some commands like latex prompt for
more input when partway done.

========(VMS-VILE)=============================================================
Unfinished items on vax/vms (dickey@software.org):

	+ the response time seems a bit slow (compared with other applications
	  running on the same machine).  possible problem areas include:

		+ observed that (at least on vms) I am getting highlighting
		  attributes being reset on each line, rather than only when
		  they change.

		+ probably am making too many calls to canonpath and
		  lengthen_path (affects performance on vms).

	+ if the current directory has changed, offer to restore it on exit. 
	  (Note that if the _device_ portion has changed, the original
	  directory should be restored anyway!).

	+ filename-completion works too slowly on vms; may be doing stat calls
	  or something else.  Also, it does not seem to start properly with

	  	":e e?".

	+ add key bindings and other support to make the vt100 keypad work for
	  me (e.g., like EDT).

	+ see if I can decode ".dia" files, if so connect it to finderr.c

	+ catch exception/signals, and restore terminal settings.

	+ make dec-shell names work in file-completion.  These are quasi-unix
	  filenames, which most of the VAX-C runtime routines accept.  If _all_
	  runtime code could use dec-shell names, I wouldn't have done any
	  native vms pathnames (sigh).  As it is, all dec-shell names are
	  automatically converted to vms-pathnames (i.e., by 'getname()').

	+ make write-pipes work (actually, flesh out to use 'npopen' coding
	  scheme, like the MSDOS stuff).

	+ I had a case in which I wanted to read the contents of one file into
	  another; they had the same buffer name; the target buffer got the
	  filename for the source, e.g.,

	  	:e []foo		- read and determined version # ok
		:r [-.temp]foo		- current filename reset to [-.temp]foo
------------------------------------------------------------


it would be nice if vile would fold text...

	This feature appeared in uEmacs version 3.10.23 and you can
use archie/xarchie to file fue.tar.Z (fue - folding-micro-emacs).

[ i believe joseph rajkumar is working on this ]


-----------

I have a couple of bug reports and suggestions for you, concerning vile
3.52 on SunOS.


5) annoying
	When I execute a keyboard macro using ^X-& I cannot repeat this
	using the dot command. Instead, the last command in the macro
	is repeated.
    [ this is because . doesn't do @ macros either...]

------------------------------
I found a bug in vile3.54 with file completion. If I type:
        :r ~/c/headed/aut<TAB>
It correctly expands it to
        ~/c/headed/author
But says [No such file "~/c/headed/author"] while this file definitely
exists.

[ can't reproduce this ]

------------------------------

I also found a hard-to-reproduce-bug where I would type some input very
fast, usually involving ^X-!, :w, etc. after which vile would no longer
accept any input. It is not completely stuck, because it still reacts
to window resizes, but it can not be backgrounded. Neither does it
react to a SIGSEGV. I tried to get it to coredump and have it save the
file and send me a mail.... Sorry I can't be anymore specific.

[ can't reproduce this ]

------------------------------

Can you add the '>' character to the list of comment chars for paragraph
reformatting?  I would live to be able to reformat mail quotes (like shown
above).

[ pgf notes: I did this, as chris suggested, but formatregion should use
  the comments regexp to match a comment delimiter at the beginning of
  line, and should insert the comment delimiter of the _second_ line (so
  that boxed C comments work right)in subsequent reformatted lines,
  including leading but not trailing whitespace.  indentlen should be
  counted _after_ the width of such a comment delimiter.  this would make
  paragraphs that are indented way after the delimiter keep their indent. 
  commented paragraphs should end when exp->mlen for the comment regexp is
  equal to llength(DOT), i.e.  it's the whole line.  (we'll need to take
  the $ off the end of the comment regexp).  ]

--------------------

	(wibni) if i started looking up tags and pressed the tab key it should
	complete the line.
	(tag completion -- good idea -- requires a buffer as in filec.c)

--------------------
	When you use the command line and you do a !<command>
	to execute something in the shell. Would you be able to make it so that 	it can complete filenames there also??
	so i could do the following:
	!ls ~daml/files/rec
[ hard.  probably not worth it. ]

----------------------------------

We are running vile under NeXT and we have
problems to set macros with the meta key.
--------------------------------

I got to compile vile at home over the weekend.  The version of
djgpp (gcc 2.4.2 - sorry, I don't know the djgpp version number)
I have didn't like this bit from estruct.h, lines (561-563):

#if ! LINUX	/* there are probably others that don't want const defined */
# define const
#endif

----------------------------------

enhancement:  reimplement error finder using regexps.

------------------------------
core dump on startup in xterm with too many rows.

------------------------------
	Another enhacement.
	How about a history file.  say I have been using vile and
	quit and come back in later I can use the history file.

--------------------------

In a xterm window the down arrow (which sends ESC-O-B) works for individual
presses.  If you hold down the key then letter Bs get peppered through out
the file.  It appears that the ESC is occasionally being missed so that the
following OB puts a B in the file.

In my case I'm on a workstation running 4.1.3 and xterm using rlogin to
connect to a 690 server (lightly loaded) running 4.1.3 and running vile
on the 690.

I just ran vile locally and didn't see the problem.
-------------------------------

PC Vile --

   1) Open a 50-line DOS box under windows.

   2) Invoke pc vile (dos box stays at 50 lines, as I would expect).

   3) Exit pc vile and the dos box goes to 25 lines. I wish PC vile would
     leave the dos box at 50 lines.

[ is this still true?  i don't see why it's happening -- we restore the
    screen mode... ]
----------------------------------


On the Sun 4, Sun os 4.1.1 vile doesn't seem to work in cmdtool or
shelltool windows (and, of course, vi does). Can you provide any help
on that? Personally, I don't use cmdtool (I prefer xterm) but a lot
of our users do use cmdtool.

I found an ugly workaround. Turning off SCROLLCODE does the job.


----------------------------------

I found a bug with vile 3.59, compiled on a SparcStation running SunOS
4.1.2. Using an xterm inserting a formfeed character gives some very
strange behaviour. When I type:
        0i^V^L
the visual line under the cursor is deleted, and the cursor moves to
the next line, 3rd row. When I now type a space the ^L appears and
everything goes seemingly back to normal. If I insert the ^L on any but
the 1st row there is no problem. Weird eh! vile 3.55 did not have this
problem.

[ cannot duplicate this on SunOs 4.1.3 ]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


I found a bug (new with 3.59) on our Pyramid SVR4 (but not Pyramid SVR3,
SunOS 4.1.1, AIX 3.2) where
	xvile tmp &
pops up the xvile window briefly, the window dies, the xterm I started
xvile from says
	[1]  + suspended (tty input)  xvile3.59 tmp
and then after a couple seconds the xterm itself vanishes!  However,
	xvile tmp
works fine, except that the process is in the foreground.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

apply Alistair's min/max regexp patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I guess, in the future, there will be an option for "xvile" which can
change the title of its window, right?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Is there any way to use termcap to define 
all of the window parameters, but still use ANSI escapes for colors?  Elvis
allows me to do this under Linux on the terminal screen and a couple of
systems allow Elvis to change the foreground and background colors under an
xterm.  If I tell Vile to compile using ANSI instead of termcap it works 
but it doesn't seem to recognize any of my termcap variables (which means
it doesn't get the right screen size or exits with incorrect colors).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When vile saves files before it dies, it puts them in /tmp on the
machine where you are editing.  In a networked environment, a person
may be editing files on several different machines and so it would be
convenient if the e-mail message stated which machine's /tmp contains
the saved files.

-----------------------------
