  This test writes a X MEGABYTE sequential file in Y byte chunks, then
  rewinds it  and reads it back.  [The size of the file should be
  big enough to factor out the effect of any disk cache.].  Finally,
  IOZONE deletes the temporary file
        
  The file is written (filling any cache buffers), and then read.  If the
  cache is >= X MB, then most if not all the reads will be satisfied from
  the cache.  However, if it is less than or equal to .5X MB, then NONE of
  the reads will be satisfied from the cache.  This is becase after the 
  file is written, a .5X MB cache will contain the upper .5 MB of the test
  file, but we will start reading from the beginning of the file (data
  which is no longer in the cache)
        
  In order for this to be a fair test, the length of the test file must
  be AT LEAST 2X the amount of disk cache memory for your system.  If
  not, you are really testing the speed at which your CPU can read blocks
  out of the cache (not a fair test)
        
  IOZONE does not normally test the raw I/O speed of your disk or system.
  It tests the speed of sequential I/O to actual files.  Therefore, this
  measurement factors in the efficiency of you machines file system,
  operating system, C compiler, and C runtime library.  It produces a 
  measurement which is the number of bytes per second that your system
  can read or write to a file.  
 
  You use IOZONE to test the I/O speed of a UNIX 'RAW DEVICE' such
  as a tape drive, hard disk drive, floppy disk drive, etc.  To do this,
  you must define the symbol NO_DELETE when you compile IOZONE.  If you
  fail to define NO_DELETE, IOZONE will treat the raw device as a 
  temporary file, and WILL DELETE THE RAW DEVICE after the test completes!
  When testing raw devices, any UNIX buffer caching is bypassed.  IOZONE
  still is using the read()/write() system calls, so you are not quite
  testing the device at the low level of say, disk controller diagnostics.
  On the other hand, that kind of testing is highly system- and device-
  specific, and my goal for IOZONE has been to build a highly portable
  benchmark -- not one which is tied to a particular operating system or
  hardware configuration.  In practice, I have tested raw disk and tape
  peripherals and the results are very close to the manufacturer's specs
  for those devices.
 
  For V1.06, IOZONE adds the 'auto test' feature.  This is activated
  by the command:  'iozone auto' .  The auto test runs IOZONE repeatedly  
  using record sizes from 512 to 8192 bytes, and file sizes from 1 to 16
  megabytes.  It creates a table of results.
        
  For V1.06, IOZONE lets you specify the number of file system sizes and      
  record lengths to test when using auto mode.  Define the constants
  MEGABYTES_ITER_LIMIT and RECLEN_ITER_LIMIT as seen below      
        
  For V1.09 you can show the development help by typing 'iozone help'
        
  For V1.10 IOzone traps SIGINT (user interrupt) and SIGTERM
  (kill from shell) signals and deletes the temporary file
        
  For V1.11 IOzone requires no compilation flags for AIX
  Also, come miscellaneous cleanups have been made to the source
        
  For V1.12 IOzone support has been added for the MIPS RISCos,
  Tandem Non-StopUX, and Tandem GUARDIAN 90 operating systems.
  IOzone is now a 'Conforming POSIX.1 Application'  (IEEE Std 1003.1-1988)
        
  For V1.14 IOzone supports Next and QNX systems.  It also prints out
  the name of the operating system when run.  There is now the option
  to force IOzone to flush all writes to disk via fsync()
  Defining USE_FSYNC will make IOzone include in its measurements the time
  it takes to actually write the data onto disk, as opposed to
  just writing into the system cache.  BSD UNIX and SVR4 support fsync(),
  but SVR3 and generic POSIX systems do not.  I have enabled USE_FSYNC
  for the systems which support it
        
  For V1.14, we now officially support AT&T SVR4.  It has worked just
  fine using SVR4 with previous versions of IOzone.  Also, for systems
  which use the times() function, we calculate the 'base time' the first
  time we ever call time_so_far(), then subtract this time from all
  future measurements.  This increases the precision of our measurement
  and fixes a loss-of-precision problem which occurred on some systems
        
  For V1.15, add the NO_DELETE symbol.  If you define NO_DELETE during
  the compilation (e.g., for UNIX systems compile with cc -DNO_DELETE),
  IOzone will not delete the 'temporary' file which it reads & writes.
  This is REQUIRED when testing RAW DEVICES such as disks and tape drives!
        
 
  This program has been ported and tested on the following computer
  operating systems:
