	  SSSSzzzz (send ZMODEM) uses	the ZMODEM, YMODEM or XMODEM error
	  correcting protocol to send one or more files	over a dial-in
	  serial port to a variety of programs running under PC-DOS,
	  CP/M,	Unix, VMS, and other operating systems.

	  This program is not designed to be called from _c_u(_1) _t_i_p(_1),
	  or other communications programs.  Unix flavors of Omen
	  Technology's Professional-YAM	communications software	are
	  available for	dial-out applications.	Unix Professional-YAM
	  supports dial-out applications with telephone	directory, a
	  powerful script language with	learn function,	high quality
	  multiple protocol support, and UUCP port arbitration.

	  SSSSzzzz sends one or more files with ZMODEM protocol.

	  ZMODEM greatly simplifies file transfers compared to XMODEM.
	  In addition to a friendly user interface, ZMODEM provides
	  Personal Computer and	other users an efficient, accurate,
	  and robust file transfer method.

	  intervention), Display of individual and total file lengths
	  and transmission time	estimates, Crash Recovery, selective
	  file transfers, and preservation of exact file date and
	  length.

	  The ----yyyy option	instructs the receiver to open the file	for
	  writing unconditionally.  The	----aaaa option causes the receiver
	  to convert Unix newlines to PC-DOS carriage returns and
	  linefeeds.


	  SSSSbbbb sends one or more files with YMODEM or ZMODEM protocol.
	  The initial ZMODEM initialization is not sent.  When
	  requested by the receiver, ssssbbbb	supports YYYYMMMMOOOODDDDEEEEMMMM----gggg with
	  "cbreak" tty mode, XON/XOFF flow control, and	interrupt
	  character set	to CAN (^X).  YYYYMMMMOOOODDDDEEEEMMMM----gggg (Professional-YAM gggg
	  option) increases YMODEM throughput over error free channels
	  (direct connection, X.PC, etc.) by disabling error recovery.

	  On Unix systems, additional information about	the file is
	  transmitted.	If the receiving program uses this
	  information, the transmitted file length controls the	exact
	  number of bytes written to the output	dataset, and the
	  modify time and file mode are	set accordingly.


	  SSSSxxxx sends a single _f_i_l_e with XXXXMMMMOOOODDDDEEEEMMMM or	XXXXMMMMOOOODDDDEEEEMMMM----1111kkkk protocol
	  (sometimes incorrectly called	"ymodem").  The	user must
	  supply the file name to both sending and receiving programs.

	  Iff sssszzzz is invoked with $SHELL	set and	iff that variable
	  contains the string _r_s_h or _r_k_s_h (restricted shell), sssszzzz
	  operates in restricted mode.	Restricted mode	restricts
	  pathnames to the current directory and PUBDIR	(usually
	  /usr/spool/uucppublic) and/or	subdirectories thereof.


	  The fourth form sends	a single COMMAND to a ZMODEM receiver
	  for execution.  ZZZZccccoooommmmmmmmaaaannnndddd exits with the COMMAND return
	  value.  If COMMAND includes spaces or	characters special to
	  the shell, it	must be	quoted.


	  The fifth form sends a single	COMMAND	to a ZMODEM receiver
	  for execution.  ZZZZccccoooommmmmmmmaaaannnnddddiiii exits as soon as the receiver has
	  correctly received the command, before it is executed.


	  The sixth form (sz -T) outputs all 256 code combinations to
	  the terminal.	 The hex value of the character, a space, and
	  the raw character are	sent, 8	per line.  In you are having
	  difficulty sending files, this command lets you see which

	  character codes are being eaten by the operating system or
	  network.  The	terminal program must be set to	display	all
	  256 codes in a distinct form.	 Check that each code is sent,
	  and that the 8th bit on codes	0x80 to	0xFF is	set.

	  Sz -T	then allows the	caller to input	characters which are
	  echoed in hex.  You should check that	all control characters
	  can be input this way.



	  The meanings of the available	options	are:

	  2222    Use two stop bits instead of one.  This option is
	       available on some Unix systems.	This slows
	       transmission slightly and may be	helpful	in preventing
	       flow control problems in	some applications.
	  ++++    Instruct	the receiver to	append transmitted data	to an
	       existing	file (ZMODEM only).
	  aaaa    Instruct	the ZMODEM receiver to convert text file
	       format as appropriate for the receiving system.	Valid
	       only for	ZMODEM.
	  bbbb    (ZMODEM)	Binary override: transfer file without any
	       translation.
	  cccc    Instruct	the receiver to	change the pathname if the
	       destination file	exists.
	  dddd    Change all instances of "." to "/" in the transmitted
	       pathname.  Thus,	C.omenB0000 (which is unacceptable to
	       MSDOS or	CP/M) is transmitted as	C/omenB0000.  If the
	       resultant filename has more than	8 characters in	the
	       stem, a "." is inserted to allow	a total	of eleven.
	  eeee    Escape all control characters; normally only XON, XOFF,
	       DLE, CR-@-CR, and Ctrl-X	are escaped.
	  ffff    Send Full pathname.  Normally directory prefixes	are
	       stripped	from the transmitted filename.
	  kkkk    (XMODEM/YMODEM) Send files using	1024 byte blocks
	       rather than the default 128 byte	blocks.	 1024 byte
	       packets speed file transfers at high bit	rates.
	       (ZMODEM streams the data	for the	best possible
	       throughput.)
	  LLLL NNNN  Use ZMODEM sub-packets of length	N.  A larger N (32 <=
	       N <= 1024) gives	slightly higher	throughput, a smaller
	       N speeds	error recovery.	 The default is	128 below 300
	       baud, 256 above 300 baud, or 1024 above 2400 baud.
	  llll NNNN  Wait for	the receiver to	acknowledge correct data every
	       NNNN (32 <=	N <= 1024) characters.	This may be used to
	       avoid network overrun when XOFF flow control is
	       lacking.
	  nnnn    (ZMODEM)	Send each file if destination file does	not
	       exist.  Overwrite destination file if source file is
	       newer than the destination file.

	  We have received numerous reports of terminal	servers
	  interfering with protocol file transfers.  Sometimes special
	  terminal server commands correct the problem.	 Some typical
	  commands are "terminal download" and "terminal no esc", but
	  there	is no standard set of commands suitable	for all
	  terminal servers.  Sometimes the terminal server software is
	  defective and	must be	upgraded.

	  Escaping all control characters (-e option) option sometimes
	  helps	get past brain damaged terminal	servers.  Restricting
	  the window size (-l or -w option) sometimes helps.  These
	  hacks	slow transfers,	better to fix the terminal server.

	  Particular attention must be paid to flow control.  The
	  modem	and Unix must agree on the flow	control	method.	 Sz on
	  USG (SYS III/V) systems use XON/XOFF flow control.  Some
	  terminal servers do not provide working flow control.	 If
	  flow control cannot be properly set up, Try a	"-w 1024"
	  option (given	to the sending program)	to enforce protocol

	  Telebit modems must not be set to "spoof" UUCP, XMODEM,
	  YMODEM, or KERMIT.  Setting one of these spoofing modes
	  interferes with other	protoocls.  Telebit's YMODEM spoofing
	  interferes with YMODEM transfers.

	  If a program that does not properly implement	the specified
	  file transfer	protocol causes	_s_b to "hang" the port after a
	  failed transfer, either wait for _s_b to time out or keyboard
	  a dozen Ctrl-X characters.  Every reported instance of this
	  problem has been corrected by	using ZCOMM, Pro-YAM, DSZ, or
	  other	program	with a correct implementation of the specified
	  protocol.

	  Many programs	claiming to support YMODEM only	support	XMODEM
	  with 1k blocks, and they often don't get that	quite right.
	  XMODEM transfers add up to 127 garbage bytes per file.
	  XMODEM-1k and	YMODEM-1k transfers use	128 byte blocks	to
	  avoid	extra padding.

	  YMODEM programs use the file length transmitted at the
	  beginning of the transfer to prune the file to the correct
	  length; this may cause problems with source files that grow
	  during the course of the transfer.  This problem does	not
