Version 2.14b:
    * The silly AutmoZmodem bug is fixed. AutoZmodem is back! Make
      sure you set the resource autoZmodemAction properly.
    * Upgraded the MultiList widget to version 3.4. Also changed the
      tranlation a bit. It's now like this:

        Button1 (left) - SingleClick: Select (like before)
        Button1 (left) - DoubleClick: Select and Launch (like before)
        Button2 (middle) - SingleClick: Select and Launch
        Button3 (right) - SingleClick: Select
        Button3 (right) - Motion: Extend Select

    * Seyon now restores the original modem attributes on exit. So if
      you have CLOCAL unset before launching Seyon, it'll be unset
      after exiting Seyon. 
    (2.13b)
    * Tried to fix a problem with KillTerminal on SVR4 systems,
      whether successful or not remains to be seen.
    * The terminal used to be killed and restarted quite a few times
      (e.g. after connection, after a script, after changing a
      sparameter via the Set window). Now it almost never gets killed,
      all communications between the main process and the terminal is
      done via a pipe.
    * New buttons under the Misc window: Edit and View, for editing
      and viewing files - replete with search/replace ..etc.
    * The resource zmodemAutoDownload is renamed to autoZmodem, and
      the resource zmodemAutoDownloadCommand is no longer supported,
      it's been superseeded by autoZmodemAction (see below).
    * New resource: autoZmodemAction. This is a simple or compound
      action that will be executed when Zmodem auto-download signature
      is detected. This action will be executed only if the resource
      autoZmodem is enabled (see above). Default is
      ``ShellCommand($rz);''. As you can see, this is much more
      general than than the old zmodemAutoDownloadCommand resource.
      For example, you can make that ``Beep(); ShellCommand($rz);'' to
      make Seyon ring th ebell beofr etsarting Zmodem.
    * The beep is now a bit fancier.
    * New resource: startupAction. This is a simple or compound action
      that will be executed on startup. This action is executed prior
      to running any script (in case the -script switch is given) or
      dialing any entry of the dialing directory (in case the -dial
      switch is given or the resource dialAutoStart is enabled). You
      can make Seyon open the dialing directory automatically on
      startup by using the simple action ``OpenWidnow(Dial);'' as a
      constituent of this complex action stack. Note that running the
      startup script is just a special case of this resource
    * The resource dialDirAutoOpen is no longer supported. It's been
      superseeded by the resource startupAction, which is much more
      general. 
    * Cleaned up the FAQ a bit.
    * Some other misc. code cleanups.
    (2.12)
    * The ill-fated change to the way the terminal is stopped/
      restarted is gone. Not to declare total defeat, I'm not back to
      the old method (which has always worked), but a new (third)
      method is introduced. This one doesn't rely on the operating
      system, but does its own dirty work, so it should work well on
      all platforms.
    * The entire manual is now available on-line via the Help button.
    (2.11)
    * Just some cosmetic changes and a small fix for SunOS 3.x.
    * Corrections to the manual.
    (2.10)
    * New actions: OpenWindow, IconifyWindow, and CloseWindow. The
      first two can take the arguments Main, Dial, and Term,
      corresponding to the command center, the dialing directory, and
      the terminal windows, respectively. The third can take the
      argument Dial. More than one argument can be given, for example:
      ``IconifyWindow(Main, Dial, Term);'' will iconify all three
      windows. Term is guaranteed to work only with terminal emulators
      that set the environment variable WINDOWID, like xterm. The
      manual has more details on all of these actions. OpenDialDir is
      no longer supported since it's obsolete.
    * Fixed a bug in the dialing process that manifeted itself on SVR4
      systems. Thanks to Felix Blank for the fix.
    * Translations for SeQuickKeys are now more robust, and SeQuickKey
      buttons now behave like other normal buttons.
    * The resource and command line switch ``modem'' is now replaced
      by ``modems''. This is a list of modems that Seyon will try one
      after the other on startup until it finds an available modem.
      Great for modem pools. MAKE SURE YOU CHANGE THE NAME OF YOUR
      RESOURCE FROM MODEM TO MODEMS OR SEYON WILL NOT RUN.
    * Seyon used to kill the terminal process before running routines
      that take control of the terminal (like dialing, script
      execution, ..etc) and restart it again after those routines are
      finished. Now Seyon merely suspends the terminal instead of
      killing it. This is more CPU-efficient since a fork() call is
      avoided each time. It's a bit less memory efficient, however,
      since the terminal process hangs around instead of being killed,
      but that process can be swapped out if memory is tight. THIS IS
      A CAN OF WORM, and there can be bugs caused by the new behavior.
      Watch out.
    * SeQuickKeys implementation is totally revised and rewritten.
      SeQuickKeys are now specified like this:

                  Seyon*quickKey1.visible: on
                  Seyon*quickKey1.action: FileTransfer(1, file); Beep(); 
                  Seyon*quickKey1.label: Upload

      The first resource specifies that the given SeQuickKey should be
      visible. The second specifies the action attached to that key,
      and the third the label. Nte the new C-like syntax and that
      asynchronous actions can be anywhere in the action stack, see
      below.
    * You can no longer use QuickKeyX, it has to be quickKeyX (i.e.
      first letter is not capital. The class name for all SeQuickKeys
      is now Command.
    * Actions now use a syntax similar to C. Semicolons delimit simple
      actions (a semicolon has to be at the end of every simple
      action), and commas delimit action argumnets.
    * Asynchronous actions can now be anywhere in a compound action
      (action stack) and they no longer have to be at the end.
      However, DialEntries will probably not work correctly if not at
      the end of a comoupnd action (or alone of course). Others are
      fine.
    * The resources dialDirAutoClose, dialDirAutoIconify, and
      beepOnConnect are no longer supported. They have been superseded
      by the new resource postConnectAction, which is more flexible.
      Actions given by this resource will be executed after a
      connection is made and before running any attached script (they
      have to be synchronous). Default is ``Beep();''.
    * New parsing routines graciously contributed by Joaquim Jorge.
      Those allowed for the new flexibility in SeQuickKeys you see in
      this release. I'm grateful to him for his contribution.
    * New action: CloseWindow. Can take the argument ``Dial'' to close
      the dialing directory window. Useful to use in the new resource
      postConnectAction. Supersedes the action CloseDialDir, which is
      no longer supported.
    * Argument of the action Echo is now optional. If omitted, a
      newline will be echoed. This is similar to the behavior of the
      shell command echo.
    * New resources: hangupViaDTR, modemHangupString, and
      modemAttentionString. The first supersedes hayesHangup, which is
      no longer supported. Refer to the manual for more details.
    * The default now is not to hangup by droping DTR since the latter
      apparently pisses off modem on mnay plaforms (Sun, SGI, ..etc.).
      You can use hangupViaDTR to override that.
    * When hanging up, the hangup and attention strings no longer show
      up on the terminal, nor the modem response. Looks much cleaner
      this way.
    * New actions: Sleep and DoNothing. The first just suspends the
      program for the given amount of seconds. The second does nothing
      (similar to NOP). DoNothing is useful to use in actions like
      postconnectAction to override the default and stop the beep.

Version 2.06:
    * Help is now a separate button from About and can be held open
      all the time without affecting other funcions of Seyon (that
      doesn't mean that help is actually helpful, however :-}).
    * Instead of beeping when not available, some buttons now become
      greyed out and unresponsive when not available.
    * Dial cancelling is improved a bit to be more robust (it's a bit
      slower to react now though) and you'll no longer see the NO
      CARRIER message from the modem when you cancel dialing (this is
      for purely aesthetic reasons).
    * Fixed a bug that caused segemntation fault on some mahines
      (notably Suns) -- thanks to the people who reported the problem
      and to Greg Eisenhauer for the fix. Also added the approrpriate
      symbol for machines that don't define MAX_INPUT.
    * Minor changes to accommodate Mips RISCos.
    * New feature: SeQuickKeys (z quickies). Extremely versatile new
      addition to Seyon that lets you add your custom buttons to the
      command center and attach actions to them. Resources related to
      this feature are quickKeyX (X starts at 1). Each of these
      resources specifies the action routine for that SeQuickKey
      button. If the action field is empty, the corresponding
      SeQuickKey button will not be shown. Labels for those buttons
      can be set via the resources `Seyon*quickKeyX.label'. Seyon
      currently offers two actions, more will be added in the future.
      Available actions are: 1) DialEntries(<entries-list>), which
      instructs Seyon to dial entries in the dialing directory
      corresponding by order to the given list. If the list consists
      of just the word `Default', then the entries given by the
      resource defaultPhoneEntries will be dialed. 2)
      RunScript(<script-name>) Executes the script file given by
      <script-name>.
    * Added a new button to the dialing directory: Default. If
      clicked, the entries specified by the resource
      defaultPhoneEntries will be highlighted. Seyon no longer
      highlights those entries when Reread is chosen.
    * Sorted the resources in the manual page alphabetically.
    * The resource dialCancel is renamed to dialCancelString.
    * More new actions than you can shake a stick at: Beep,
      DivertFile, Echo, FileTransfer, Hangup, ManualDial, OpenDialDir,
      Quit, Set, ShellCommand, and Transmit. Most of these actions
      take one or two arguments, and can pop up dialog boxes if not
      all information is provided. Everyone can now have his/her own
      version of the command center, and the basic buttons are almost
      obsoleted. Details are in the manual page.
    * You can stack actions, e.g. Echo("Byebye..") Hangup() Quit()
      will echo the string, hangup the line, then quit Seyon. You can
      attach mini-script to SeQuickKeys this way. Examples are in the
      manual page.
    * Action DialEntries no longer opens the dialing directory. This
      way you can attach SeQuickKeys to frequesntly-dialed hosts and
      completely bypass the dialing directory (I rarely use the
      dialing directory now). You can still get the behavior by
      stacking: OpenDialDir() DialEntries(whatever).
    * You can now have up to 10 SeQuickKeys. This limit is really
      arbitrary and can be increased any time.
    * MultiList is now used for the transfer console as well. looks
      better, and can click Go instead of double-clicking if you like.
    * Action RunScript will now pop up a dialog box if no script-name
      is specified.
	* Quick release to fix some bugs in the new actions.
	* No more garbage character at end of modem reponses.
	* Action OpenDialDir now de-iconifies the dialing directory if in
	  an iconic state. 

Version 2.01:
    * Fixed a bug that caused a segmentation fault when using both
      manual dialing and auto-redial.
    * Added speedup enhancement to the terminal. People with fast
      machines or slow modems probably won't notice this, but on my
      hardware (386SX-25 and 9600 bps), the terminal process is about
      40% faster (rough benchmak: 3 seconds to repaint an Emacs screen
      compared to 5 seconds). This is done by writing text to the
      terminal in chuncks instead of a character at a time. I'm
      interested in feedback about this.
    * Added toggles to show the modem line status: DCD (Data Carrier
      Detect), DTR (Data Terminal Ready), DSR (Data Set Ready), RTS
      (Request To Send), CTS (Clear To Send), and RNG (Ring
      Indicator).  This, I suspect, won't work for HP-UX, since it
      does things a bit differently. If your O/S doesn't have support
      for this (most do), you can disable it by undefining
      HAVE_MODEM_CONROL in config.h.
    * Added a clock to show the on-line time. The clock also doubles
      as a toggle to show the DCD status (see above).
    * New resource: modemStatusInterval. This resource controls the
      amount of time (in seconds) between updates to the modem status
      toggles (including the clock). The default is five seconds, but
      you can set it to one second (or any other number) if you want
      the toggles to be updated more frequently. Even if you set this
      to a large number, Seyon is intellegent enough to update the
      toggles after each connect or hangup.
    * New resource: stripHighBit. If set to 'on', the high (eights)
      bit is stripped from incoming characters. This corresponds to
      the the old sevenBitMask that was removed a while ago. The
      corresponding script keyword is also stripHighBit. You can also
      set this from the settings window.
    * The lock routines have been revised a bit. Seyon now also
      supports the inode.major.minor nameing convention for lock files
      used by SVR4 (thanks to Jeff Johnson and Glenn Geers for the
      patches).
    * Revised config.h a bit to be more flexible and more consistent.
      Especially affected are the lock configurations.
    * Seyon is now less agressive in speeding up the terminal process
      (still much seedier than before) to maintain the same level of
      interactivity as past versions. 
    * Incororated some modifications to accommodate Solaris (thanks to
      Tony Vincent-Sun-Vienna for the patches).
    * New resource: hangupBeforeDial. If set to 'on' (default), then
      Seyon will hangup the line before dialing (if there is already a
      connection).
    * Changed the location of popups a bit. Now most popups are
      located at the center of their parent buttons.
    * Modem responses (BUSY, ..etc) now show up in the message area
      instead of at the terminal when no connection is achieved.      
    * Cleaned up the code bit and fixed a bug in detecting Zmodem
      signature that was introduced in the previous version.
    * HAVE_STRDUP is removed from config.h since strdup is no longer
      needed.
    * Now the high bit is always stripped if the character size is
      different from 8. This is transparaent to the user.
    * Added a new reource: modemVMin. This specifies the number of
      characters that should be in the buffer before the read process
      is satified. The read process will wait until that number of
      incoming characters is in the buffer or 0.1 second has elapsed
      between two characters before displaying those incoming
      characters. This results in the data being displayed in chunks
      and speeds up the terminal display. The speedup would be most
      noticeable on slow machnes with fast modems. Leave this resource
      at its default (1) or set it at a low value (6) if you have a
      slow modem (e.g. 2400bps). Otherwise you might set it to the
      maximum value, which is platform-dependent but generally 255. If
      you set it to any number greater than the maximum value it will
      be truncated to the maximum value.
    * Fixed a bug that caused the dialing directory and transfer
      windows not to be destroyed properly when the 'reread' button is
      clicked. Also fixed a small race condition in the terminal
      process. 
    * New resource: ignoreModemDCD. If this is set to 'on', the modem
      DCD status will be ignored. Some of the consequences of setting
      this to on is that the "Hangup?' prompt will always be presented
      (if exitConfirm is enabled) regadless of the modem DCD status
      and dialing will be attempted even if Seyon thinks you're
      on-line. It's highly recommended that you keep this set to 'off'
      unless your modem doesn't honor the DCD line. Default is 'off'.
    * New resource: defaultPhoneEntries. This is a list of numbers
      corresponding to the entries in the phonebook. Seyon will
      highlight (select) those entries at startup and whenever you
      click 'Reread' in the dialing directory. This is useful if there
      is a set of entries that you most frequesntly dial and want them
      to be highlghted automatically instead of doing that every time
      by hand. You can override this resource by the new -entries
      command-line switch, for example: -entries "1 3 4". The quotes
      are needed if you specify more than one entry. Phonebook entries
      numbering starts at one.
    * New resource: dialAutoStart. This resource specifies that Seyon
      should start dialing the entries specified by the resource
      defaultPhoneEntries (or its override command-line switch) on
      startup. Seyon will commence dialing those entries after
      executing the startup script and any script specified at the
      command line. If enabled, this resource overrides
      DialDirAutoOpen and forces it to be on. A more convenient way of
      automatic dialing on startup is to use the command-line switch
      -dial, which forces this resource to be enabled. If the resource
      is enabled, it can disabled at the command line by the switch
      -nodial.  Sepcifying both -dial and -nodial at the command-line
      will select the bahavior specified by the last such switch on
      the command line.
    * Now Seyon will not present the 'Hangup?' popup if off-line even
      if exitConfirm is enabled (unless ignoreModemDCD is set to on).
    * Seyon will now abort dialing if on-line and hangupBeforeDial is
      disabled (unless ignoreModemDCD is set to on).
    * New script command: hangup. It just hangs up the line.
    * The script command quit is now enabled. you can use it to
      terminate the script and exit the whole program. Use 'exit' to
      just terminate the script.
    * New resource: beepOnConnect. If set to 'on', Seyon will ring the
      bell when a connection is made. Default is 'on', so make sure
      you disable this if it annoys you.
    * The way Seyon looks for files has changed. Now Seyon no longer
      looks in the user's home directory, and looks in the current
      directory only after looking in the default directory (~/.seyon
      by default). Hence the new order is: default directory, then
      current directory. If this causes a problem to anyone, let me
      know and I might change things back to the way they were.
    * If you have neither termios not termio, Seyon can now work with
      sgtty. This is to accommodate older BSD systems like SunOS 3.x.
      Thanks to Bob Smith for the patches for this.
    * New script command: shell. This will execute a shell command and
      bahaves like the Shell button on the command center (i.e. it
      accepts '$' for stdio redirection to the modem). With this
      command it is possible now to write a script to do unattended
      login and download of mail from a host (e.g. BBS) with an entry
      in, say, crontab. A script for unattended download of QWK mail
      packets is included as script.QWK.
    * Fixed a race condition that would have happened if both -script
      and -dial are specified. Also cleaned up the startup code so
      that the startup script is executed in a child process like
      other scripts.
    * Added some more version information on startup (similar to that
      of linux).
    * Bug fixes: the lock file and script bugs are now fixed. This
      should be mostly a bug-free release.
    * If the ioctl call to get the modem line status fails, Seyon will
      now automatically disable the modem status toggles for that
      device and will refrain from polling that device for its status.
      All this until you open another device or re-open the same
      device.
    * New command-line switch: -emulator. You can now specifiy which
      terminal emulation program Seyon should use by te above switch.
      For example: 'seyon -emulator aixterm' will make Seyon use
      aixterm as the terminal emulator. As usuall, Seyon will fall
      back to xterm if it cannot execute the requested emulator. This
      switch make the link to seyon-emu less usefull, but it's still
      supported.
    * Cosmetically overhauled config.h. It's much cleaner now and uses
      the more understandable YES and NO instead of define and undef.
    * The script command 'set port' is not supported in this release.
    * Installtions using X11R4 and such do not have some of the imake
      macros. I've added those to the imake file.
    * New resource: dialDirAutoIconify. If set to on, Seyon will
      automatically iconify the dialing directory window when a
      successful connection is made. Otherwise the dialing directory
      will remain up until closed or iconified by the user. If both
      dialDirAutoClose and dialDirAutoIconify are set to on, the
      former takes precedence. Default value is 'off'.
    * A small bug in the lock files for SVR4 is fixed, also a bug
      related to dialDirAutoOpen. Also, 'if linked' now works
      properly.
    * Rewrote the low-level modem read routines. Much cleaner now
      (except one function) and hopefully less prone to bugs. Also
      cleaned up miscellaneous parts of the code.
    * Unified program: there in no longer seyon-cmd. You can get the
      same behavior as seyon-cmd by using the -noemulator switch, see
      below. Thanks for David Boyce.
    * New command-line switch: -noemulator. If this is specified,
      Seyon will not launch a new terminal emulator, but will use the
      existing one instead. You cannot use the '-- emulator_option...'
      switches if this option is given.
    * New command-line switch: -noargs. Seyon usually invokes the
      terminal emulation program with some options to set the
      application name, window and icon titles, ..etc. If this switch
      is given, Seyon will not pass those options to the emulator.
      This is to accommodate terminal emulation programs that use a
      different command-line syntax than xterm, like xvt, cmdtool,
      shelltool, ..etc. You can use the '--' switch to pass your own
      options to the emulator in this case.
    * The command-line switch -noargs is renamed to -nodefargs.
    * More changes to the low-level modem read routines. Now all of
      them have been rewritten.
    * Some changes in the look, mostly to be ain accord with Xaw3d.

Version 1.9:
    * The baud rates are now represented by radio buttons instead of
      requiring the user to type them manually. This has the advantage
      that the user can no longer choose an invalid baud rate (besides
      looking cute, of course).
    * Fixed a few minor bugs (the dialing directory shows a spurious
      script for the last item, script command 'dial' doesn't accept
      '^M', script keyword 'linked' doesn't work, exitConfirm resource
      mistyped in the source and swapped with hangupConfirm). all
      fixed now.
    * Added error checking for modem reads/writes. Seyon now tells the
      user when such errors occur and why they occured. The program
      also suspends the terminal process when an excessive number of
      such consecutive errors occur (5). You'll see how that is sueful
      if you specify a port with a non-existent modem as your device
      (do it at your own risk though, some oparting systems may lock
      up your machine f you do so).
    * Added a new script command: when. This is a very versatile
      command and behaves in a similar fashion as the corresponding
      command in Qmodem. Briefly, if you have something like

              when "Continue?" "y^M"
              when "More?"     "n^M"
              waitfor "Command?"
              when

      then while waiting for "Command? ", the script will transmit
      "y^M" whenever it encounters "Continue?" and "n^M" whenever it
      encounters "More?", whatever the number of times it encounters
      those strings. The final when (with no argument) clears all
      outstanding when commands. Some BBS systems (notably PCBoard)
      change the prompts depeding on the time of your call, and you
      cannot write a complete script for such boards using waitfor
      only. An example is included.
    * Cleaned the script module a bit and also the routine for
      detecting the zmodem auto-download signature.
    * Revised the interface for the settings window. Seyon now changes
      the parameters as soon as the user clicks on them instead of
      waiting until the 'Ok' button is pressed. A bit less efficient
      perhaps, but more natural. You can now keep the settings window
      open and try out different settings without having to close the
      window in order to effect your changes.
    * Transient windows no longer concealed by their parents, even if
      they don't have the input focus. Didn't you just hate it when
      those windows used to disappear behind their parents and you had
      to move their parents in order to see them? No longer.
    * The exit and cancel buttons are no longer hidden when they are
      inactive. Instead, they are now visible all the time, but greyed
      out when inactive. Looks better this way.
    * When you choose f.delete (twm/mwm) or QUIT (olwm/olvwm) on
      Seyon's top window (the command center), Seyon now exits
      gracefully as if you clicked on the exit button (but with no
      confirmation). Seyon will beep if you try to do that while
      you're not allowed to exit though. Even though it is safe to do
      so, I do not recommend this as the way to exit Seyon. Also,
      never do this on any other Seyon window (like the dialing
      directory) or Seyon won't exit gracefully. (In general, if Seyon
      gets stuck and you have to kill it, do that by

           kill <lowest-seyon-pid> 

      from another xterm. Seyon will quit gracefully this way as
      well).
    * Added two new script commands: flush and purge. The first
      flushes the mdoem, i.e. discards data written to the modem but
      not transmitted and data received but not read. The second Reads
      and discards all data coming from the modem for the duration of
      one second.
    * The manual page now has a listing of all the keywords the script
      command 'set' accepts.
    * Revised the idle guard routine so that the idleGuardInterval is
      now observed properly.
    * New default font. I suspect most people will hate it, so it may
      be removed from the next version if I hear many gribes about it.
    * New error popups. Now Seyon pops up an dialog box with an
      explanation of the error, possible causes, and suggested action
      when an error occurs. Not all errors are handled this way yet,
      but the most severe ones are. Please do give this version some
      abuse (e.g. invoking it with no modem, wrong modem, locked
      modem, incorrect command-line switch, or even doing something as
      evil as 'kill -SEGV <lowest-seyon-pid>').
    * Seyon now has an icon. Try iconifying the command center (or the
      dialing directory) to see it.
    * Arnold is out, a pretty face is in.

Version 1.8:
    * The transfer window has been completely revamped, just like the
      dialing directory (see below). Only the protocol titles now
      appear in the window (those can be as descriptive as you like).
    * Since the dialing directory and transfer console no longer show
      the actual phone and protcols files but only a pretty summary,
      the syntax of those files has been made much more flexible. They
      now accept whole-line comments and blank lines, so you can put
      as much comments there as you like. Examples are provided.
    * Provided examples for the phone and protocols files with
      extensive documentation (thanks to the new syntax fexibility).
      Please look at them to take full advantage of the convenience
      they provide.
    * The dialing directory have been completely revamped. No more
      ugly keywords on the display, replaced by a standard, concise,
      and informative dialing directory. The keywords still work of
      course, it's just that you see only their summary on the dialing
      directory, rather than the phone file syntax itself.
    * For the new dialing directroy, added the resource dialDirFormat.
      This is a string that specifies the format of the dialing
      direcotry. The default is '%-15s %-15s %6s %1c%1c%1c %1c%1c %s'.
      Briefly: the fields represent the host name, number, the baud
      rate, bits, parity, stop bits, whether there is a custom prefix,
      suffix, and the script name. You can understand more what each
      field refers to by comparing with dialing directory, fields that
      use the current setting (via the keyword CURRENT) are designated
      by a question mark. Notice that you cannot change the order the
      items in the dialing directory appear at, only the format.  For
      example, since the numbers I call are all 7-digits, my host
      names are short, and I never use baud rates above 9600, my own
      format string is %-10s %-8s %5s-%1c-%1c-%1c %1c%1c %s, the
      default is just too wide for my taste, and I like dashes between
      the bits, parity, ans stop bits fields.
    * Renamed the resources dialAutoOpen and dialAutoClose to
      dialDirAutoOpen and dialDirAutoClose, respectively, to reflect
      their functions more precisely.
    * Add an important feature: the ability to completely specify the
      communication parameters by number of bits (charcter size),
      parity, and stop bits. Like eeverything else in Seyon, you can
      set those in about a half dozen ways. First, the resources
      defaultBIts (default is 8, valid arguments are 5, 6, 7, and 8),
      defaultParity (default is 0, valid arguments are 0 (no parity),
      1 (odd parity), and 2 (even parity), and defaultStopBits
      (defaults is 1, valid arguments are 1 and 2). You can set them
      in a script through the keywords bits (e.g. set bits 8), parity,
      and stopBits. You can also set them in the dialing directory by
      specifying the fileds BITS, PARITY, and STOPB (you can also give
      the argument 'CURRENT' to those fields. Finally, you can set
      them interactively under the settings window (in two ways,either
      directly or via a short cut).
    * The resource sevenBitMask and the script keyword 7bit are gone.
      they superseded by the above.
    * Added a new button: 'About'. Among other things it tells you
      exactly what revision number of Seyon you're using. The help
      button is moved under About.
    * Some cosmetic changes; for example, Seyon messages in the status
      area are now centered.
    * Added support for fallback resources. Seyon no longer need its
      app-defaults file except for color (using color in fallback is
      not a good idea).
    * Added a new button under the 'Misc' window: Suspend. This just
      suspends the terminal and runs a local shell in the terminal
      window. 
    * Seyon now supports two new speeds: 56700 and 115200 bps. This is
      avialable only for linux, as there is no portable way of doing
      it. This feature is not guaranteed to stay.
    * Added a new script command: send_break. Should be obvious what
      it does.
    * Fixed a nasty bug (race condition) when Seyon is invoked with
      the -script switch. That should work fine now.
    * New resource: dialAutoOpen. If set to on, the dialing directory
      is automatically poped up when Seyon is started.
    * The resource funMessages is now used to specify the messages
      only. Use the new resource showFunMessages to enable or disble
      the display of those messages (defaults to on).
    * Added a new feature: the ability to send a string when the
      session (user's input to the terminal) is idle longer than a
      specicified amout onf time. The string is sent automatically at
      that regular interval to keep the session alive (e.g. avoid
      auto-logout). The resources governing this feature are:
      idleGuard (default is off), idleGaurdInterval(default is 300
      seconds), and idleGuardString (default is " ^H", i.e. space then
      backspace). The corresponing script keyword is idleGuard (you
      can only enable or disable it in a script). The string is sent
      with the current translations, so it would be <Spc><del> if
      backspaceTranslation is on.
    * You can now put '~' in 'transmit' to effect a pause of 1 second,
      i.e. transmit "ATZ~~ATS0=0" is equivalent to
                    transmit "ATZ"
                    pause 2
                    transmit "ATS0=0"
    * Changed the default color for toggles to look better with Xaw3d.
      If you're not using Xaw3d, I advice to get it and link Seyon
      with. Seyon looks much "cooler" with Xaw3d.

Version 1.7:
    * Revied the location of transient popups. No more dangling
      windows. Now transiet windows pop up at a small offset from the
      the top of the parent window instead of its buttom.
    * New resource: dialAutoClose. If set to 'on', the dialing
      directory will be automatically closed after a successful dial.
      Defaults to 'off'.
    * The baud and port dialogs in the settings window now popup
      instead of cluttering the window and causing it to be too large. 
    * Added a new keyword for the dialing directory BPS and BITS
      fields: CURRENT (can be abbreviated to CUR). If this is used,
      the current baud rate and/or bit mask will be used for that
      host. Not sure if this would be useful. Notice that if the BPS
      or BITS field is missing, the default values (as specified in
      the resources) would be used.
    * Added two new fields in the dialing directory: PREFIX and
      SUFFIX. If either is present, it overrides the default specified
      in the resources. See examples in the included phonelist file.
      These fields also accept the CURRENT  keyword as above.
    * All script commands and keywords are now case sensitive.
    * Revised newline translation. Three translation modes are now
      available: no translation, newline to carraige return, and
      newline to carraige return / line feed. Consequently, the
      resource newlineTranslation is changed from boolean to string,
      whith three possible keywords corresponding to the above: nl,
      cr, and cr/lf. The script keyword nl is also changed to
      newlineTranslation to coincide with the resource, and accepts
      the same keywords.
    * Added 'View Log' under the misc window, but currently does
      nothing. 
    * New script command 'echo'. This just behaves as the usual echo
      shell command and prints its argument to the terminal (does not
      send it to the modem, use 'transmit' for that). This command
      supercedes the old command under the same name, which is now
      more appropriatetly called 'debug'.
    * Essentially got rid of the busy waits in the program -- even for
      systems that do not have usleep -- by using Seyon's own usleep
      if the system doesn't have one. (written by obz@raster.kodak.com). 
    * Seyon now does not allow the user to exit the program while it
      is executing an externala command until that command is finished.
      (this is a feature, since exiting while a child process is still
      running can lead to a lot of trouble).
    * The default color for monochrome displays is now black on white.
      Earlier versions tried to use color even if none is vailable, so
      the color combination led to unreadable menus on monochrome
      displays. Note that if you have a color display you must put
      something like:
                #ifdef COLOR
                *customization:         -color
                #endif
      in your Xdefaults file, or Seyon (as well as other X
      applications) will be monochrome even on your color setup (but
      you already know that, don't you :-).
    * Various changes to accomodate SunOS 4.1 (thanks to Peter Davies
      for pointing most of those problems).
    * New configuration script. This script probes your system looking
      for the functions your system has and automatically writes
      config.h for you. Tested only under bash and ksh, not sure if it
      would run under plain old regular sh. Give it a try.
    * YADBC, yet another default background color. This one is more
      reminiscent of Motif.

Version 1.6
    * You can now change the modem device interactively from the 'Set'
      console. You can even do that in a script, use the keyword
      'port'.
    * Support for the environment variable MODEM has been dropped.
      You can set the modem device on startup either via the resources
      or at the commend line.
    * Running a script by the switch '-script' in startup was broken
      (apparently for some time but nobody told me, I found out by
      accident). It has now been fixed.
    * You can now start a script interactively from the command
      center. Use 'Script' under the 'Misc' button.
    * Fixed the lock routines. Seyon now supports two types of lock
      files: ascii (compatible with HDB uucp), and binary (for other
      uucp programs). You choose which type of lock interface by
      defining the appropriate flag in config.h before compiling.
      Thanks to rick@rick.att.com for supplying information about the
      different types of lock methods. Anthony Rumble originally
      pointed out the problem.
    * Added a new resource, hayesHangup. If this set to on, Seyon will
      use the Hayes hangup command sequesnce. Otherwise, hangup is done
      by dropping DTR. This should normally be set to off (default),
      unless your modem doesn't hangup when DTR is dropped. Consult
      your modem manual for more details.
    * Seyon now uses the correct Zmodem signature (thanks to Ralph
      Brown for supplying me with that). You should no longer have
      any problem with Seyon not recognizing Zmodem auto-downloads.
    * Although not very apprent on the surface, the dialing routines
      have undergone a major revision. The code is now much cleaner
      and uses pseudo-signals to do much of its work.
    * You can now upload a text file by using 'Divert' under the
      'Misc' button. This sends the file (slowly) to the remote host
      as if typed on the terminal. You can start an editor an 'divert'
      the file there as if you were typing the file, useful for
      composing messages on-line on bulletin boards.
    * Seyon's look is slightly revised, and the command center now has
      two  rows of buttons by default, so it's a bit less wide.
    * Related to the above: you can now rearrange the number of rows
      of buttons in the command center in a much easier way. Just
      specify the the resource Seyon.width, and the number of rows will
      be calculated automatically to fit the requested width.
    * If the app-defaults file is left from an older version, Seyon
      now tells the user what version that was.
    * Various other small fixes and enhancements.
    * On the down side, I have not updated the FAQ since the previous
      release, and 'don't feel like it'. If you want something added
      to the FAQ, send it to me, and I'll gladly add it (or if someone
      wants to be the maintainer of the FAQ, let me know).

Version 1.5
    * Zmodem auto-download can now be disabled and enabled
      interactively (from the 'Set' console) as well as in a script
      (use 'set autozm on/off'). Useful when you want to use a
      different zmodem protocol from the transfer popup.
    * Improved error handling. Seyon now gives the user more
      informative messages about what the rogram succeeded or failed
      to do in the form of error messages, warnings, and notices.
    * The new boolean resource sevenBitMask now supercedes the old
      defaultBitMask (no longer used). Seyon will use a 7 bit mask if
      the resource is true (otherwise an 8 bit mask) for entries in
      the dialing directory for which no bit mask is specified. The
      default for this resource is ''off', i.e. to use an 8 bit mask.
    * A new translation mode (my favorite): meta key (ALT)
      translation. Use it to send keys pressed while the meta (ALT)
      key is held down as an escape (ESC) followed by the key press.
      This mode simulates the meta key on hosts that do not support
      8-bit-clean connections and makes possible the use of the meta
      key in programs like Emacs on such hosts. It is enabled by
      default. You can control it in the resources by the resource
      metaKeyTranslation, in a script by 'set meta_tr ...', or
      interactivly from the 'Set' console.
    * All the parameters that can be set in startup script can now be
      specified in the resources. This can be done via the new
      resources sevenBitMask, newlineTranslation,
      backspaceTranslation, metaKeyTranslation, xonxoffFlowControl,
      and rtsctsFlowControl.
    * New (worse?) default window background color.
    * Seyon now gives a warning if the app-defaults file is missing,
      mis-installed, or out-dated. 
    * To facilitate the use of terminal emulators other than xterm,
      xterm is no longer hard-coded into Seyon. Seyon will try to use
      seyon-emu first, and if it cannot find it will fall back to
      xterm. seyon-emu should be a symbolic link to the terminal
      emulator of your choice, e.g. xterm.
    * You can now temporarily suspend Seyon and run a local shell in
      the terminal window. Just use the shell button and give it an
      empty string as the command to be run.
    * Substituted the less-general HAVE_TERMIOS for _POSIX_SOURCE
      while building Seyon. Apparently, 386BSD has termios but chokes
      when _POSIX_SOURCE is defined.
    * Fun messages are no longer hard-coded in Seyon but can now be
      specified in the resources via the resource funMessages, which
      superceeds the old boolean resource under the same name. refer
      to Seyon's manual page for details.
    * Command-switches can now be passed to the terminal emulation
      program as well. The new seyon command line syntax is:
      seyon [-option ...] [-toolkit_option ...] [-- -emulator_option]
      Any switches after '--' will be passed to the terminal emulation
      program.
    * The default zmodem auto-download command is now '$rz' instead of
      'rz', to use stdin/stdout.
    * The manual page is expanded a lot. Now is has a full description
      of all the resources, as well as a detailed description of the
      script language. Please take the time to read it.
    * Various other small enhancements.

Version 1.4
    * Added support for rereading and editing the phonlist and
      protocols files from withen Seyon.
    * Added support for capturing a remote session to a file.
    * Fixed a few bugs in the termio routines.
    * Cleaned up the code a bit and added some comments

Version 1.3
    * Seyon now uses termios to be POSIX-compliant. The old termio
      interface can still be used however.
    * Major change to the way Seyon finds its files. Seyon now expects
      its files to be in its own default directory (~/.seyon) and
      would look first in the current, then default, then home
      directory for its files. Like other things in Seyon, the default
      directory can be overridden in the resources.
    * A default script directory can now be specified. Much better
      than cluttering the home directory with scripts. Seyon will look
      for scripts in the current, then script, then home direcotry.
    * Revised the interface of the dialer. Buttons are now visible all
      the time, even if not active (but will beep if clicked while
      inactive). 
    * Added full support for manual dialing
    * Integrated the help file and the FAQ. Hence, the FAQ is now
      vailable online via the 'Help' button.
    * Seyon now has a manual page (but not complete).
    * Changed a few other things to make Seyon more portable to other
      platforms and corrected some minor bugs.

Version 1.2:
    * Setting the baud rate interactively is now fully supported.
    * The 'show' button has been removed since it's no longer needed.
    * The dialer timeout is now fully supported. Use the resource
      "dialTimeOut" to set it (default is 45 sec).
    * Added multiple dialing. Seyon will now circulate through
      selected items in the dialing directory until a connection is
      made. Refer to the FAQ to see how this is used.
    * Added two new resources, dialPrefix and dialSuffix.
    * The dialing directory and transfer console now have scroll bars
      and would can be scrolled if they contain more than 10 entries
      (no limit on the total number of entries).
    * Cleaned up the dialer code quite a bit

Version 1.1:
    * Major revisions to the dialer. The dialer is now integrated into
      the dialing directory instead of having its own popup (no need
      to clutter the screen).
    * Fixed it so that there may be no more than one copy of the
      dialing direcotry. 
    * The transfer popup now pops down after the transfer is
      initiated. Similarly the shell popup.
    * Auto ZMODEM download is now fully supported. See tha FAQ to
      learn how to set it up or disable it (thanks to R. Ramish for
      supplying the auto download string).
    * Seyon now has an Imake file (kindly contributed by David Boyce,
      with minor modifications by me).
    * The dialing directory now 'remembers' its location and size if
      moved or resized interactively.
    * The status area is now fully supported. most of the messages now
      appear there instead of at the terminal.
    * Seyon now shows some 'fun' messages in the status area if it has
      nothing else to say (I know, I got carried away. Anyhow, it can
      be disabled, see the FAQ).

Version 1.0:
    * Fixed a problem with the new dialer. Now the dialer should work
      fine even if your modem behaves in a non-standard way.
    * Added five new resources. these are connectString and
      noConnectString[1|2|3|4]. You can set these up according to your
      modem, but the defaults should work for most people. See the FAQ
      for more info.
    * The delete mode (backspace sends delete) now actually works.
    * The dialer now gives more informative messages about what it's
      is doing.
    * Implemented the rtscts mode. Not sure if it works.
    * Added a new 'refresh' button, to refresh (restart) the terminal.
    * Added a new status bar, but not used yet.
    * Fixed a bug in the terminal routine and removed the kludge
      introduced in the previous version.
    * Fixed another bug that used to start a stray CIS receive in the
      terminal mode.
    * Cleaned up the code a bit and added a few comments.
    * Changed the default shape style (again!) to be more fun. 
    * Added a meke depend target to the make file.

Version 0.85:
    * Added the ability to send a break. You can do that via the
      'Misc' button. 
    * Corrected a bug in obtaining the dialer resources.
    * Modified the dialing procedure (introduced in the new dialer) to
      work on more modems.
    * Added the ability to disable confirmation popus for hangup end
      exit. You can set that via the resources. See the FAQ for more
      info. 
    * Removed XMODEM and Compuserve CIS from the code. Those should be
      implemented though external programs.
    * Added a kludge in the terminal routine to go about the linux new
      FPU emulation problems with re-entrance.

Version 0.8:
    * Most the functions under the 'Set' button are now
      implemented. The ones that are not are the cts/rts and
      setting the baud rate.
    * Seyon now has a brand new dialer. It dials the number upto a
      specified number of retries with a specified interval between
      each try (both can be set via the resources). After a
      connection the script will be executed (if one is given).
      Dialing and script execution can be interrupted anytime by
      clicking a botton.
    * Fixed a minor bug in hangup confirmation. The hangup
      confirmation window now disappears after choosing an action.
    * Added a new parameter. Those that want to send delete
      instead of backspace (some BBS systems choke on it) can now
      do that either form the 'Set' button, or through the startup
      file or any script. See the FAQ.

Version 0.5:
    * Added a new transfer console that invokes a pre-defined
      protocols ala minicom and all DOS comm programs.
      Intelligent enough to prompt for a file name if needed.
    * Added support for specifying the modem port in the
      resources.
    * Added a new shell button to pass commands to the shell.
    * Moved the status button to be a part of tge set 'Set'
      console and added initial implementation to the set
      console (not functioning yet).
    * The hangup button now asks for cofirmation.
    * The exit button now asks if you want to hangup before
      exiting.
    * Corrected the '-g' switch problem (now '-script') and
      enabled the execution of a script specified at the
      command line.
    * Added a FAQ and a CHANGELOG files.
    * Updated the help file
    * Fixed various minor problems.

Version 0.0: 
    Initial release
