    * Seyon should start even if no modem is given?
    * Should handle more than one modem session simultaneously?
    * Have a log of all important messages  

    * Enhance the script language.

    * The code definitely needs some cleaning up.

- hot-keys.  You are already doing ALT-translation: if you could offer
  hot-keys for scripts, it would be pretty nifty.  Starting up 'sz' with
  AltGR+S or something like that..

    (This list has shrunk over time from a long one to just the above.
    If you have any suggestion, let me know about it). Needless to say,
    feel free to implement any of the above, as I'm not going to do
    that any time soon.
