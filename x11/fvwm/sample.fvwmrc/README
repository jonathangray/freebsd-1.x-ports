This is where I'm collecting .fvwmrc files that people might find useful.
Mostly, these files cause fvwm to emulate some other window manager.

These are not to be considered finished works. Anyone who can improve them 
is welcome to, and should send me anything worthwhile

If you use the m4 patches, look into adding undefine(`include')
just before your iconPath or pixmapPath line.
