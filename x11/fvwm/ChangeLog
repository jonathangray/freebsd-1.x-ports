ze to zf
	1. Fixed minor error in pager geometries.

1.21zd to ze
	1. Fixed the problem of vestigial decorations for swallowed
	   windows.
	2. Made NoBoundaryWidth 0 actually give a boundary-width of zero.
1.21zc to 1.21zd
	1. Added "swallow" to GoodStuff

1.21zb to 1.21zc
	1. Colormap handling changes.

1.21za to 1.21zb
	1. A couple of residual focus-on-root patches.
	2. Minor tweak to FvwmWinList, replacing c==' '
	   with isspace(c)
	3. XSendEvent at the end of HandleButtonPress needed 
	   a little extra filtering.

1.21z to 1.21za
	1. Appied still more patches about unions status wait....
	2. Updated 4Dwm.fvwmrc
	3. Switched to FvwmWinList version 0.4. Made some minor tweaks to
	   FvwmWinList in the process.

1.21y to 1.21z
	1. Added HOSTDISPLAY enviroment variable; should be a network
	    ready version of DISPLAY
	2. Added SloppyFocus, which works like the default focus-follows-
	   mouse, except that focus stays witht the window until you enter
	   a new window.
	
1.21w to 1.21 y
	1. Fixed up LookInList, so that
		Sticky xbiff
		Notitle XBiff
	   will have the expected result. Note: this is not making
	   the string comparison case-insensitive, but is performing an
	   exhaustive search for matches, instead of stopping at the first
	   match.
	2. Gave GoodStuff buttons that can remain pushed in until
	   an application actually materializes. In Exec commands,
	   the qouted portion of the command will be compared to
	   names and classes of new windows, until a match is found,
	   then the button will be release. Qouting an empty string
	   will restore the original behavior.
	   
	   This needs to be extended: it should be possible for a 
	   button to remain pushed in until the application dies,
	   or to grab the application icons, or to grab the application
	   window itself (for xclock, xbiff).


1.21v to 1.21w
	1. Fixed focus-on-warping problem.
	2. Fixed StickyIcons in new FvwmPager
	3. Fixed circulate up/down handling of windows that don't
	   accept focus
1.21u to 1.21v
	1. Added built-in Focus for use by FvwmWinList
	2. Made fvwm ungrab the pointer just prior to
	   invoking a module. Allows modules to do natural
	   pop-up menus if desired.

1.21t to 1.21u
	1. Added FvwmPager code to detect
		*FvwmPagerFont none
	   which causes the desktop-labels to be omitted.
	2. Added FvwmPagerRows and FvwmPagerColumns
1.21s to 1.21t
	1. Remove most of HandleLeaveNotify, since it caused occasional
	   focus loss.
	2. Cleaned up colormap focusing
	3. Added StartIconic and IconGeometry
	   to FvwmPager. Needs a little work
	   still.
	4. Updated FvwmWinList to ver 0.3
	5. Fixed up focusing for click-to-focus and colormap
	   handling.
	
1.21r to 1.21s
	1. Applied patch to FvwmWinList
	2. Changed comment delimiter from ## to
	   /* */ in Imakefiles.

1.21q to 1.21r
	1. Beat up on the makefile and configure.h
	2. Added AppsBackingStore, SaveUnders, and
	   BackingStore as run-time options. They
	   used to be compile time.
	3. Remove NO_MORE_COLORS compile time
	   option.
	4. Made LENIENCE a run time option.
	5. Fixed the focus-on-root problem


1.21p to 1.21q
	1. Added FvwmWinList
1.21o to 1.21p
	1. Big clean up for focus control. Completely
	   eliminated CheckAndSetFocus().
	2. Big time, really stupid and quite serious bug in My_XNextEvent
	   was fixed. This caused some events to be skipped, and others
	   to be processed twice.
	3. FvwmPager now has a "current desk only" pager for an icon.
	   If you have a line like 
		Icon "Fvwm Pager"   map.xpm       
	   get rid of it! This icon does not yet allow you to move windows
	   or viewports.
	4. Iconic view of the pager now also allows the user to
	   move windows and viewports within the icon.
	5. Can now drag windows out of the pager onto the
	   desktop for final placement.

1.21m to 1.21o
	1. Fixed some segmentation faults
	2. Fixed Raise operation with no on-top windows.
	3. Cleaned up sample config files.

1.21l to 1.21m 
	1. Fixed focusing problems caused by sometimes processing
	   events out of order.
	2. Split M_ICONIFY module message into M_ICONIFY and
	   M_ICON_LOCATION.
	3. Fixed up pager for monochrome user
	4. Added window-labels to the new pager.

1.21k to 1.21l
	1. Improved handling of ONTOP windows, so they
	   no longer fight each other for top-billing. Also,
	   a window-manager induced raise will not briefly raise
	   the target window above the ONTOP's.
	2. Gave the FvwmPager the ability to move keyboard
	   focus to a window which you select by clicking with
	   button 2. Focus can only be given to 
	   windows on the current desk.

1.21h to 1.21k
	1. Made FvwmPager understand initial stacking order
	2. made windows stay on desk when de-iconifying.
1.21g to 1.21h
	1. Added the built-in WindowsDesk to move a window to
	   another desk, without having to go through
	   the stick-changedesks-unstick process. Made the
	   pager module use this option.
	2. Added a man pager for FvwmPager and an FvwmPagerLabel
	   command.
1.21e to 1.21g
	1. Fixed a focusing bug. Seems to affect motif windows.
	2. Got the new FvwmPager module mostly written. People
	   can try it out, but there's no man page yet.
	   It lets you drag windows between desktops, and you can
	   see all desktops at once. The B&W mode isn't done, and
	   window-labels don't show up in the pager. Also,
	   the move-windows-between desktops is clumsy.
1.21e to 1.21f
	1. Make AddToList case sensitive, since re-extracting
	   info is case sensitive. May have a small effect on
	   config files.
        2. Modified the re-start procedure so that it was more
	   reliable for some people.
	3. Started writing a pager module. Its not done, so
	   don't bother with it yet.

1.21d to 1.21e
        1. Changed smart-placement grid from 10 pixels to 3
	2. Changed mapping/unmapping scheme for multi-desktop
	   operation. I had noticed a problem, triggered as
	   follows.
	   1. Set StartOnDesk Maker 2
	   2. Start Frame-maker 4.0
	   3. Wait for startup screen.
	   4. immediately change desks.
	   5. Wait for the top-level buttons for framemaker to
	      show up.
	   6. While fvwm switches back to the frame-maker desk, trying
	      to map the frame-maker buttons, the initialization
	      screen tries to unmap itself.
	   7. fvwm got confused, and left an undecorated init
	      screen displayed, which frame-maker thought was unmapped.
	   Solution: when changing desks, only unmap the parent, not
                     the window itself. This means that windows don't know
		     they were removed from the screen.
	3. Changed time stamp for XSetInputFocus from CurrentTime to
	   lastEventTime, to be more ICCCM compliant.

		     
1.21c to 1.21d
	1. Added MWMHintOverride.
	   I suppose this should open a dialog box to confirm the
	   override before actually proceding. Maybe some day....
	   
1.21b to 1.21c
        1. Fixed the problem of sending 2 de-iconify messages to
	   modules.
	2. Added FvwmSound in the optional directory.
	3. Got smart about m4 pre-processing and modules. The m4-processed
	   .fvwmrc file is saved in /tmp for use by modules.
	   Modules are passed the name of the pre-processed file
	   (/tmp/fvwmrcXXXXX) to read. File is delete on exit from fvwm.
	4. Fixed a border-width error in smart-placement.

1.21 to 1.21b
	1. Fixed bitmap handling in revised GoodStuff module.
	   (Used to fail with BadMatch).
	2. Changed a few instances of FvwmInitBanner to FvwmBanner.


1.20z to 1.21
	1. Finished conversion to 14 or less character file names.
	   Unfortunately, module names are changed:
		FvmInitBanner ->FvwmBanner
		FvwmNoClutter ->FvwmClutter
		FvwmModuleDebugger ->FvwmDebug
		FvwmIdentify -> FvwmIdent
		FvwmSaveDesktop -> FvwmSave
 	   For existing sites with >14 character file names,
	   these changes could be addressed with a handful of
	   links in the /usr/lib/X11/fvwm directory, if desired.

	2. Tidied up a little code in fvwm itself, created
	   colormaps.c to handle colormap switching code, moved
	   Iconify and DeIconify into icons.c, and move all window-placement
	   code into placement.c

1.20y to 1.20z
	1. Fixed icon-desktop selection. Particularly affected
	   restarts with icons on desks other than the
	   current desk.
	2. Started shortening files names that are more than 14
	   characters. I only did the easy stuff so far.
	3. Ammended Module calling sequence to pass one user-specified
	   command line argument. 

	   This argument is the entire
	   body of the Module command line in the .fvwmrc file,
	   after the actual name of the module. It may contain
	   spaces, qoutes, whatever. For example, in:
		Module	"FvwmIdentify"	FvwmIdentify Hello rob! -fg purple
	   the argument would be "Hello rob! -fg purple" all passed in
	   argv[6]. Of course, no modules use  this option yet.

1.20w to 1.20y
	1. Fixed qouting problem in FvwmSaveDesktop.
	2. Fixed one really stupid bug, and made improvements in
	   GoodStuff to reduce re-draw frequency. Should be much
	   better now.
	3. Added the PagingDefault patches.

1.20v to 1.20w
	1. Fixed seg fault on second-level pop-ups, as reported in the
	   mail channel
	2. Fixed colormap handling, at least enough to run
	   toolchest on SGI's

1.20u to 1.20v
	1. Improved complex functions a bit:
		a. Can now have 
			Function "Move-or-Raise"
			        Raise           "Motion"
			        Move            "Motion"
			        Raise           "Click"
			        RaiseLower      "DoubleClick"
			EndFunction
		   which used to fail unless the move was done first.
		b. Now detect motion by a pointer movement of
		   5 pixels or greater, or by expiration of
		   click-time, whichever occurs first. Delays waiting
		   to decide on whether an event is a click or motion should
		   be minimized.
		c. Can now bind complex functions to the root window,
		   AS LONG AS NO BUILT-IN IN THE FUNCTION REQUIRES A
		   TARGET WINDOW. This will typically be used to create
		   menus that stay up after a click:
			Function "StickyMenu"
				PopUp "Motion"	MyMenu
				PopUp "Click"   MyMenu
			EndFunction
		   or to overload a mouse button:
			Function "Overload"
				PopUp "Motion" Menu1
				PopUp "Click"  Menu2
				WindowLost "DoubleClick"
			EndFunction
		   this should provide a superior user interface for people
		   with only one or two mouse buttons (mostly macintosh and
		   PC people, I guess).
	2. Made the pager update during moves and resizes only after the window
	   in the pager moves 2 or more pixels. This should improve interactive
	   response. GoodStuff needs some big-time clean up for opaque
	    move users, though.


1.20s to 1.20u
	1. Added some extra support for keeping transients on the same
	   desk as their parents, and for keeping window groups together.
	2. Added a minor correction. If a transient was unmapped because
	   its parent was iconified, the pager was not getting updated
	    correctly
1.20p to 1.20s
	1. Added support for interpreting the mwm-hints functions field
	   not all done yet.
	2. Added MWMFunctionHints
	3. Added resize-on-window-placement, remove now uneeded FvwmResizeModule
	   Resize is triggered twm style (pressing button 2) if MWMMenus
	   is not selected. Triggering is mwm style (shift-button 1) if
	   MWMMenus is selected.
	4. Added StartsOnDesk, and patches to remember desktop
	   number of windows through re-starts. (Thanks to
	   Mr. Miyamae miya@pen214.prod.cpg.sony.co.jp)
	5. Improved reliability of FetchWMProtocols, which is used
           to scan for WM_DELETE_WINDOW and WM_TAKES_FOCUS
	6. Made Add_window switch to desktop of new window before
	   popping up the outline.
	7. Fixed operation for Sun's Wabi, running on a solaris 2
	   machine, display on a xterm, fvwm running on SunOS4.1.3.

	   Problems included focusing and colormap obnoxiousness by fvwm.

	   Looks good now, only tried wabi itself, since I don't have
	   any windows apps to try out.

1.20f to 1.20p
        1. Added some window placement corrections
	2. A few tweaks for move and resize operations. I think they're a
	   little smoother now.
	3. Made Icon placement for sticky icons always on the current
	   page. Otherwise, you can't ever see them.
	4. Made Focus policy ICCCM compliant, I think. No longer
	   assigns focus to windows that don't accept focus, like
	   xload (NoInput model). 
	   Openwindows cm (calander manager), which uses the Globally
	   Active model, still works OK.
	5. Added configuration option XORvalue for users of 24 bit color
	   machines.
        6. Added MWMDecorHints to the configuration options. Use
	   NoBoundaryWidth 4 for best results. Shading of narrow-but-still
	   there frames needs some work!
        7. Fixed up border drawing in a few spots to allow for the new
	   mwm hints stuff. Still needs a little work for MWMBorders.
	8. Replaced system(action) with an execl() as suggested by
	   (lubkin@cs.rochester.edu).
	9. Fixed error from #4 above, where an application (Frame-maker
	   dialog boxes) didn't ever get the input focus because they
	   did set wmhints but did not set the input field.
	10. Really radical colormap handling changes. Maybe this will bring fvwm
	   into conformance with the icccm.

1.20 to 1.20f
	1. Fixed a bug in the modules, where fvwm would hang trying to
	   write to a module whose write buffer was full. Also, a
           few very minor other patches were made.
	2. Fixed a bug in strcasecmp.
	3. Added a missing KeepOnTop() to the FocusOn routine, which
	   is used by circulate up/down and warp.
	4. Cleaned up a top-level makefile, added script MakeMyMakefiles
	   since my version of Imake seems to be broken. Removed MakeMe
	   and InstallMe. Removed all -Wall flags for subdirectory
	   Imakefiles. Now specify compiler and flags in the top
           level Imakefile.
	5. Made safemalloc in all units handle specified lengths of
	   0. It gets called this way when reading an EndWindowList
	   packet from fvwm.
	6. Improved detection of mouse-on-edge-of-screen, by
	   Hermann Dunkel, HEDU, dunkel@cul-ipn.uni-kiel.de
	7. Made DeferExecution sensitive to pressing and releasing
	   the mouse buttons in different windows.
	8. Cleaned up window-move and resize code. Maybe more
	   responsive now.
	9. Finally fixed menu-exposure problem with pager and GoodStuff.
	10.Fixed(?) placement for windows with border width != 1.
           May help fvwm pass tcl/tk window manager tests.
	11.Fixed error in which InstallWindowColormaps was accessing freed
	   memory sometimes.
	12.Fixed border color problem stimulated as follows
		1. Iconify
		2. Stick
		3. De-Iconify.
	13.Restored ability to change viewports while waiting to select
	   a window.
        14.Added SAVE_UNDER_EVERYTHING, a compile time option to trade 
	   extra memory for increased re-draw speed when moving/raising/
	   lowering windows. Also added USE_BACKING_STORE and
	   USE_BACKING_STORE_FOR_APPS_TOO.
	15. Oops. number 11 above caused a core dump. Fixed it.
1.18d to 1.20
        1. Added -DSTUBBORN_ICONS
	2. Remove -DCENTER_SIZEWIN, made it toggle with MWMMenus
	3. Eliminated use of Makefile, always use Imake now,
	   edit configuration.h in this directory, instead of
	   separate Imakefiles. Create top level script MakeMe
	   to do the build. See README.Install
	4. Fixed a menu bug where a window popping up near the
	   bottom of the screen immediately pops up a sub-menu, and
	   the base menu fails to draw itself.
	5. fixed an error in icon auto-placement relating to wide 
           icons at the screen edge.
	6. Incorporated SAVE_DESKTOP patches. No man page yet.
	7. Twiddled focus control for multi-screen displays a 
	   bit more.
	8. Eliminated the Lost X connection stuff. It was causing
           trouble for some people.
        9. Added lots of capacity for modules and fvwm to talk to each
	   other.
        10. Made Iconify take an optional argument to limit actions to
            either iconification or de-iconification.
	11. Fixed a long standing bug regarding positioning of icons
            that change their name of bitmap, and are not being
	    auto-placed. Corrections work for Frame-maker. Haven't
            got LEmacs to try.
        12. Fixed lock-up problem with icons that are big and hang
            over the edge of the screen.
	13. Fixed problem with killing modules.
        14. Added lots of capability to the module interface. Documented
            in subdirectory documentation. Some minor changes need for
            existing modules (done).
        15. Modified Send_WindowList function to send all info necessary
	    for the module to estimate the current fvwm status,
	    including desktop number, paging status, focus.
	16. Added several command line arguments for modules, so that they
	    can tell if they are invoked from a window context, etc.
	17. Added a module packet type, so that a module can request
            a window list, and then tell when the complete list has been
            sent.
        18. Made NoClutter have user-configurable time-outs and actions.
	19. Fixed flaw in GoodStuff. If you linked it to "TermStuff" then
            you could pretend that you had a TermStuff module, but
	    "OtherStuff" wouldn't work because it has a different number 
            of characters.
	20. Move the XAllowEvents in HandleButtonPress to AFTER
            the window was raised. Helps prevent application
            pop-up menus from showing up below the application window.
        21. When De-Iconifying, with Center-On-Circulate, in click
 	    to focus mode, we were centering on the de-iconified window,
	    which was incorrect. All fixed now.
	22. Sub-menus popped up near the bottom of the screen had an
            undesireable pointer warp in MWMMenu mode. Fixed.
        23. Mailing List set-up
            To subscribe:

            mail to majordomo@shrug.org with the body of the message:

            subscribe fvwm

            That's all there is to it.  To send to the list, mail to 
            fvwm@shrug.org, or to get me direclty mail to 
            fvwm-request@shrug.org
	24. Added FvwmIdentify module. Removed from unsupported patches.
	25. Ooops - bug in broadcastConfig for fvwm-1.19p, fixed. Seemed
	    to cause lockups every now and then.
        26. Split MakeMe into MakeMe and InstallMe
	27. Separated the module-tester from NoClutter. Added missing
	    free's for module packet readers. General module clean-up;
        28. Changed CirculateSkipIcons to a run-time configuration in
            .fvwmrc, instead of compile time. Also, StubbornIcons, 
	    StubbornIconPlacement, StubbornPlacement, and OpaqueResize
        29. Fixed another obscure cause of crashes, stimulated as follows
	     A> Pop up an xcalc
	     B> Resize it really big.
             C> While its redrawing itself (its slow) type q, in the window
	     D> Move mouse to the title-bar.
	     E> As soon as the title-bar redraws itself (should happen
	        before xcalc finishes redrawing), hit middle mouse button,
                to bring up menu.
             F> xcalc window responds to the "q", by exiting.
	     G> Window decorations, and popped-up menu are still there
	     H> Choose "Destroy" from the menu.
	     I> fvwm crashes.
	30. Slightly faster resizes and moves, due to improved drawing 
	    of size window
	31. Created FvwmSaveDesktop module, removed builtin "Save".
	32. Created FvwmInitBanner module. Silly.
	33. Renamed all modules to Fvwmwhatever, so that I don't
	    tread on program name-space. Left GoodStuff alone, since
            its been available for some time.
	34. Module clean-up. fixed Installatipn directory of modules.
1.16c to 1.18d
	1. Added support for multiple desktops via the DESK built-in.

	   BUG: All windows wind up on desk 0 after a re-start.

	   Intentional: No support for providing a pager-like view of
           other desks. This will be supported in a module later.

	2. Enhanced the windowList to allow display of
  	     all windows
	     only windows on the current desktop
	     only windows on a specified desktop
	   also, can use the window name or the window's icon name in
	   the list.

	3. Fixed the business about raising windows and transients
	   together. (Accidentally broke it some time ago).
	
	4. Decided that some windows are not setting the WM_DELETE_WINDOW
	   protocol fast enough, so fvwm doesn't know its set. Made 
	   fvwm re-read the window property, to make sure. 
	   Fixed problems with Mailtool not deleting properly. Probably
	   not the real problem, though.

	5. Incorportated the m4 patches into the core distribution, using
	   option -DM4. -DCENTER_SIZEWIN came with it.
	6. Switched to xpm-3.3. No real changes needed, except re-copying
	   xpm.h and commenting out one prototype that gcc -Wall
	   -Wstrict-prototypes had problems with.  Still compiles for
	   xpm-3.2, even with the new header file.
	7. Switched m4 method of obtaining the USER name to 
	   the same method that rxvt uses. Was GETENV("USER"); which
           is unreliable. Also changed XmuGetHostname to gethostname,
	   since it eliminates the use of a whole slew of libraries.
	8. A few mwm_like.fvwmrc improvements from bobw@PROCASE.COM
	9. An update SGI_4DWM-like.fvwmrc from tabaer@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu
       10. Added code to detect cursors moving from one screen to another
	   on a multiple screen display, so that focus control can be handled
	   better. Left some debugging printfs in place so I could
	   get feedback from people about what's going on.
       11. Arranged for fvwm to pass the name of the config
	   file that it used on to each module, in the command line.
	   This helps modules select the correct config file (GoodStuff
	   didn't in earlier releases), and eliminates the definition
	   FVWMRC, the directory for the system.fvwmrc file, in all
	   places except the fvwm Makefile
       12. Made GoodStuff accept the Delete Window Protocol.
Version 1.17 skipped altogether.

1.16b to 1.16c
        1. Fixed Segmentation fault from failing to modify
	   Scr.Hilite when destroying hilighted window.
1.16 to 1.16b
	1. Fixed a conflict with auto-raise and the GoodStuff module.
	
1.15 to 1.16
	1. Incorporated portability improvements from
	   Rogers Huw
	2. Icorporated speed improvement for ComplexFunctions fro
	   Makoto Matsushita
	3. Fixed bitmap color problem for GoodStuff on monochrome screens.
	4. Trimmed down the total number of colors in the icons that
	   I supply. Should alleviate colormap clogging a bit.
        5. Added NoPPosition for emacs-18 users and others who
	   tired of windows placing themselves sometimes.
	6. Added NEEDS_SIGCHLD so that people can omit the
	   SIG_CHLD stuff if needed.
	7. Merge -DMENU_HOTKEYS and -DWINDOWLIST_HOTKEYS into
	   -DHOTKEYS
	8. Added SmartPlacement, which is even better than the button-bar.

1.14 to 1.15b
	1. Mostly updated the man pages, etc.
	2. Marked module pipes close-on-exec just after the module
	   forks, so that other programs don't inherit the pipes.
	   If other programs inherited the pipes, fvwm couldn't
	   re-start correctly.
	3. Cleaned up warnings under various compilation flags
1.13 to 1.14
	1. Yay! Multi-screen mode works CORRECTLY!
	   changed references to XSync(dpy,Scr.screen) to
	   XSync(dpy,0). The second argument means throw away
	   events if its non-zero. No wonder it didn't work.

	   Important note: 
	     1. Re-starts affect each screen sepately.
	     2. Quitting requires a quit from each screen.
	     3. Multi-screen mode is not normally compiled 
	        in.
	2. Removed references to Scr.d_visual.
	3. Cleaned up some icon creation code.
	4. Finished a good version of GoodStuff. Everyone
	   should try it. Sorry, no man pages yet.
	5. Included all referenced pixmaps and any bitmaps
	   which are not part of the X11 distribution, in 
	   the fvwm_icons directory.

1.12 to 1.13
	1. Added my ongoing "module" support, and created a
	   subdirectory "GoodStuff" which contains the beginning
	   of the first module. To try it out, compile with
	   fvwm -DMODULES, add *GoodStuff business to
	   .fvwmrc (look in GoodStuff/sample.fvwmrc).
        2. Added patch to detect loss of server connection.
	3. Added IconPath and PixmapPath upgrades (now works
           like regular unix path.
	4. Added TogglePage Command to enable/disable
	   page toggling
	5. Pruned a few lines of code in Iconify(), unneeded
	   because of re-parenting
	6. Fixed up Makefile.noImake.

1.11 to 1.12
	1. Fixed some bizarre window-positioning problems that occur
           during re-starts when either window gravity was not set or
           it was set with XSetNormalHints instead of XSetWMNormalHints.
	2. Modified Icon auto-placement to place on the same screen
	   as the center of the window, not necessarily on the
	   current screen.
	3. Fixed up some oscillation problems with focus control,
	   regarding the property DOES_WM_TAKE_FOCUS. Seems to affect
	   openwin clients mostly
	4. Touch ups for shadow colors on ALPHA machines.
	5. Fixed a source of core dumps during iconification
           in click-to-focus mode
	6. Fixed a flaw in the WindowList's paging when trying to
	   find a window.
	7. Assorted fixes to focus handling and flickering borders.
	8. Incorporated patches for mxterm solid/hollow cursor probs.
	9. Made MWM-style menus pop up with the upper left of the menu on
           the mouse. 
	10. Fixed 1-pixel over the edge problem with maximize and edge
	    resistance.
	11. Made multi-screen support a compile time option. Made fvwm
	    pass the -s command line option when restarting in multi
	    screen mode.	
1.10 to 1.11
	1. Fixed the stupid 1 pixel offset that I always have for shaped
	   no title windows.

1.09 to 1.10
	1. Fixed up some focus handling a bit. Probably, some clients shifted
	   the input focus to their children, confusing fvwm.
	2. If MWMButtons is enabled, fvwm omits the right side buttons
	   for transient windows, like mwm.
	3. Updated the system.fvwmrc and mwm_like.fvwmrc files.
	4. Added an Immediate option to complex functions.
	5. Added function Warp, like Circulate, but de-iconifies as
	   it goes.
	6. Improved focus handling for iconification and de-iconification.
        7. Added StickyForeColor and StickyBackColor for sticky windows,
	   if compiled with -DMORE_COLORS
	8. Added IconPath and PixmapPath to make config files simpler

1.07 to 1.09
	1. Changed Scr.Focus to Scr.Hilite
	   ungrabbed to Scr.Focus
	   previous_focus to Scr.Previous focus.
	   All fallout from the Lucid emacs focusing nonsense.
	2. Added prototypes to allow compilation on SunOS using
	   -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes with GCC. For Linux,
	   -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes has never been a problem.
	3. Fixed it so that icons could get the focus once again
	   (broke during the Lucid emacs work).
	4. Fixed circulateup/down again. (Still more fall out
	   from lucid emacs).
	5. Fiddled with focus and colormap control when paging,
	   esp for keyboard-induced paging. Removed all use
	   of colormapNotify, since it seemed to be unneeded.
	6. Incorporated assorted motif-like patches
	7. Added visual button press info for all windows,
	   unless -DMOTIF is used, in which case, only title-bar
	   windows are done.
	8. Implemented somewhat more conventional sub-menus,
	   left justified all menus, except for titles. Added 
	   NoBoundaryWidth for decoration width on undecorated
           windows.
	9. Changed all #ifdef MOTIF's to if(Scr.flags & MWM....)
	   There are 3 options for the .fvwmrc:
	        MWMborders
		MWMbuttons
		MWMMenus.
       10. Fixed error in handling of RaiseLower when window is 
	   partially obscured by a StaysOnTop Window.
1.06 to 1.07
	1. Changed several instances of strncasecmp to strcasecmp to
	   improve handling of menu binding for people who like
 	   to have several menus with similar names.
	2. Fixed (?) problems with windows moving during re-starts.
	   (caused by mods to restorewidthdrawnlocation which were
	   supposed to help with disappearing dialog boxes)
	3. did a few mods regarding placement of windows on de-iconification
	   (try to de-iconify onto the current screen).
	4. Fixed ComplexFunctions so that they work correctly when
	   called from a root window menu.
	5. Added a patch from mark@ofps.ucar.edu (Mark Bradford)
	   to correctly handle bindings to keysyms that have multiple
	   physical keys.
	6. Fixed CenterOnCirculate. This ought to cause serious
	   grief for the unsupported_patches, since it changes the
	   definitions for Scr.flags.
	7. Fixed up operation for actively following the real input
	   focus (Lucid Emacs). Now, the highlighted window should be
	   the one that really has the input focus, not the 
	   window that fvwm thinks should have the focus. This is achieved by
	   having EnterNotify and LeaveNotify (or ButtonPress for click to
	   focus) call setFocus only. When a FocusIn or FocusOut is received,
	   fvwm updates the border color. The variable ungrabbed tells which
	   window fvwm last sent the input focus to. The variable
	   Scr.Focus tells which window is currently high-lighted.

From 1.05 to 1.06
	1. Fixed up detection of iconified windows on re-starts. Should
	   lead to ability to re-start without loosing iconic state. Allows
	   re-starts from mwm without loosing iconified windows.
	2. Fixed up so fvwm respects iconic state accross re-starts. 
           Restarts to and from mwm and olwm respect this too. Twm fails to
	   respect the new stuff, but windows don't get lost, so it should be
	   OK.
	   (All this because I kept loosing my clock when re-starting into
	   fvwm from mwm).
	3. Fixed a minor error in button3 handling around the pager 
	   decorations.
	4. In click to focus mode, corrected window-focus stack on window 
  	   iconfication.
	5. Added correction for unmapping dialog boxes. May help with
	   problems of disappearing dialog boxes.
	6. Corrected flaw in Sticking and Unsticking windows failing
	   to make the window show up/disappear in the pager.
	7. Corrected a problem where deleting (not destroying) a
	   window caused the next key-binding action to be executed twice
	   IF the pointer wound up in the root window after the
	   destroy. (Wow, weird).
	8. Made Icon placement respect application supplied icon placement
	   hints
	9. Once the icon is moved, fvwm will no longer auto-place it.

From 1.04 to 1.05
	1. Fixed a minor flag in SetMapStateProp
From 1.03 to 1.04
	1. Eliminated the appearance of a (NL) character preceding
	   the 2nd column menu entries.
	2. Made title-bar and title-bar-button popups line up neatly under 
	   their buttons. A nice little touch.
	3. Whacked up the mwm-like.fvwmrc to use the new -DHOT_KEYS
	4. Fixed problem with de-iconifying pager causing warping.
	5. Added code to raise all of a windows transients with
	   the window itself.
	6. Fixed (?) a problem with border color errors on windows
	   that unmap themselves and re-map quickly
	7. Made default for menu popups to request save_unders.
	   Quicker re-draws after a popup. Added a compile
	   time option to get rid of it.
	8. Compiled with -Wall and -Wstrict-prototypes again, and fixed a
	   few minor errors. Removed all references to Xos.h, since it
	   seems to be unneeded.
From 1.02 to 1.03
	1. #ifdef'd out this:
           If a window is moved using pager and meets opaque
           move criteria, move the window itself in real-time too.
	   since it caused problems for some people.
	2. Fixed the move-window indicator to display 12 characters, which
	   was needed to indicate +1024 +1024.
	3. Integrated patches for menu hotkeys and motif-like appearance
	   right into the main source, since these are neatly #ifdef'd
	   Left the default configuration as it was. Flags can be set
	   in the makefile
From 1.01 to 1.02
	1. Fixed up pager code a bit.
	   Leave grid lines on during a button3 drag in pager.
	   If a window is moved using pager and meets opaque
	   move criteria, move the window itself in real-time too.

From 1.0 to 1.01
	1. Fixed some border-drawingf details for tiny windows.
	2. Fixed a possible crash condition during startup in
	   MoveResizeViewportIndicator
	3. Fixed a minor boo-boo in click to focus handling
	   when mouse activities are bound to window events.

To Do List (Sorted by # of requests):
	Nothing


From 0.99 to 1.0
	1. Fixed the problem with grid lines not showing unless
	   a pager font was used.
	2. Removed flags |= VISIBLE from RaiseWindow in pager.c
	   It prevented correct auto-raise operation.
	3. Fixed the pager window title color problems.
	4. Added a move-window location indicator similar
	   to the one for resizing from Henrique Martins 
	   <martins@hplhasm.hpl.hp.com>
	5. fixed the window-resize wrap around problem.
	6. Added code to move pager representation of windows as 
           the real window moves/resizes.
	7. Changed XCopyPlane for drawing icon pixmaps
           to xcopy area, so that apps can pass color pixmaps
	   to fvwm. Beat up on icon pixmap drawing to let it
	   handle application supplied color icon pixmaps
           and shaped icon pixmaps.
	8. For cases when NumberOfScreens > 1, added a query
	   to check for current screen prior to setting keyboard
	   focus. Should fix problems of mysteriously loosing
	   focus. Problems of not re-drawing decorations on expose
	   events for screens other than 0 remain.
	9. In order to get both matlab and xv to stop walking their
	   windows around when the re-configure themselves, I had
	   to re-parent application windows inside a parent that
	   is exactly the same size as the app window. While I was in
	   there, made fvwm re-parent undecorated windows, since this
	   simplifies some things. Also, can now have seperate cursors
	   for the four corners, which is ofter requested. (Why do
	   matlab and xv have to be too smart for their own good?)
	10.Tidied up above code, now let AddWindow() drop the decorations
	   any old place, then let SetupFrame clean up the mess.
	11.Middle-clicking on a window in the pager no longer moves
	   the pager image of the window.
	12.Changed to DrawImageString for pager labels, so that they are
	   readable in monochrome.
	13.Tried to improve icon autoplacement for icons that
	   are too wide or tall for the icon box.

From 0.985 to 0.99

	1. Took a whack at multi-screen support.
           Had to explicitly draw menus when they pop-up. They
           didn't seem to get expose events properly.
	2. Repaired the default-icon support.
	3. Got xpaint dialog boxes to work. I was doing an
	   XMapSubWindows() which caused xpaint's watch-
           window bizareness to break if the window was
	   not re-parented! (All subwindows of the
           main application window got mapped).
	4. Re-worked the pager for efficiency & improved
	   appearance. Added PagerForeColor
	5. Made LookInList case sensitive again.
	6. Incorporated OpaqueMove and EdgeScroll Improvements 
	   from Henrique Martins <martins@hplhasm.hpl.hp.com>
	7. Added OpaqueMove to the default setup, with a 
           percentage above which rubber-bands are used again.

From 0.98 to 0.985
	1. Fixed some typos in fvwm.1
        2. Fixed a clicktofocus test (typo) in
           functions.c, FocusOn();
        3. Fixed Foreground color usage in decorations.
        4. Fixed placement of application supplied windows.
        5. Patched up mwm_like.fvwmrc, so that it would delete
           windows if you double click on button 1.
	6. Added code to grab buttons and keys in icon windows,
	   just in case.
	7. Removed some WM_STATE setting for parent and icon windows.
           caused editres to break.
        8. changed 
		struct _gravity_offset 
		{
		  int x, y;	
		};
	  in  add_window.c back to an int structure for RS/6000 users
	  who had problems when it was char x,y;
	9. Added a little functionality to CirculateUp/Down
	10.Added user-selectable config file.
	11.In GrabEm, Changed PointerGrab mode from false to true.
	12.Fiddled AutoPlace so that if an Icon is going to wind up
	   partly off the screen, it moves it back on. Now, if you
	   specify an iconbox thats ot tall enough, along the bottom
	   of the screen, Icons end up lined up neatly.
        13.Fixed an unsigned/regular int problem in pager code which
	   caused windows to "wrap around" if you moved them partly
	   of the pager window.
	14.Improved EdgeResistance scrolling code so that it
           makes sure that the mouse stayed in the scroll region of
	   the screen for the entire delay period. (It used to just
 	   check the start and stop points.
        15.Removed lots of XGetGeometry and XSync calls to try
           to speed things up. Suppressed error messages relating to
           input focus and Colormap installation along the way.
        16.Merged all name_lists into a single list with a flag
           to tell what attributes are set. Saves memory in the list
           and allows for expansion.
        17.Fixed a few missing pixels in mono mode for menus and title-bar.
	18.Major overhaul of borders.c, add_window.c, including touches to
           other modules, under the guise of speed enhancement.
	19.Added option for WindowListSkip.
	20.Added compile time option to skip iconified windows when
           circulating.

From 0.975 to 0.98
	1. Improved handling of Icons that change their
           pixmaps. They no longer switch positions, and if
	   they go from no pixmap to having a pixmap, that
           is detected and handled.
        2. Fixed Circulate Up/Down to handle SuppressIcons
           and shaped windows.
	3. Improved AutoRaise handling when used in conjunction
           with application pop-up windows.
	4. Fixed bug where all 10 title-bar buttons show up if you bind
           something to "A" (all contexts)
	5. Fixed problem of clicking button 2 in the pager causing windows to
           shuffle around a bit.
	6. Fixed problem where moving an icon in the pager window caused only
           the label to move.
	7. Added code to unmap icons supplied by application windows during 
           re-starts.
        8. Added code to check for window existence prior to setting the
           input focus to that window. Eliminates some internal errors.
	9. When using application-supplied icon windows, added code to 
           reparent the icon window to the root window, because olwais
           (and maybe others) make the icon windows children of the application
           window.
	10.Stopped clearing the icon pixmap window since its not needed and
           causes flickering.
	11.Compiled with -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes and cleaned up a lot
           of the warnings. Suns don't seem to have prototypes for a lot
           of standard functions like fprintf, so I can't leave these in.
           Some items of siginificance were found and correct, must was of
           no real concern.
        12.Ran Purify on fvwm, found a few items of no real significance.
        13.Remove the check for pointer motion from HandleMotionNotify, 
           since that kept us from scrolling in deferExecution. Consolidate
           all EdgeScrolling by pointer motion code into one routine in
           the pager, HandlePaging
	14.Added StickyIcons.
	15.Changed all Bool type flags in the Scr structure to flags in an
	   unsigned int. Should allow easier expansion in the future.
	16.Added IconBoxes (up to 4). Removed keyword AutoPlaceIcons, since
	   an IconBox line implies this.
	17.Fixed up code for title-bar buttons, so that they never draw over
           the frame corners. Also fixed the way left side buttons are
 	   drawn for shaped windows, and the way the title-bar, top and
	   bottom side bars are drawn for really teeny windows.
	18.Added code to optionally label the windows in the pager
	   with a really teeny font.
        19.Added a call to WaitForButtonsUp() at the end of addWindow(), since
	   it seemed to be possible to loose the input focus by moving the
	   cursor really fast after adding a window.
	20.Added IconFont (optional) for icon labels. To do this,
	   changed the PagerGC to FontGC, whose sole purpose in life
	   is to host miscellaneous fonts. Defined a macro in misc.h
	   to switch the font for FontGC.
	21.Switch from using XShapeCombineShape to XShapeCombineRectangles
	   to make shaped window title-bars. Does it all in one call,
	   much faster. Also move Shape setting code to its own subroutine
	   for ShapeNotify events. Moved SetupFrame to borders.c
	22.Fixed problem where windows partly off the top or left of the 
	   desktop didn't show up in the pager.
	23.Made the window list use the middle of the window as a test
           of on/off screen/desktop, instead of all sorts of bizarre
	   quantities.
	24.Consolidated a few config.c subroutines while adding EdgeResistance.
	25.General clean up in events.c, borders.c, functions.c

From 0.97 to 0.975
	1. Changed getdtablesize() to sysconf() in events.c
           (getdtablesize doesn't exist in HP/UX.
        2. Added a ConstrainSize call to the Maximize routine
           in functions.c (thanks to Pete Bevin <pete@sst.icl.co.uk>).
	3. Fixed misc bugs in AutoRaise and WindowList
        4. Allowed ^N, ^P, ^f, ^b shortcuts in addition to arrow keys


From 0.96 to 0.97
	1. Fixed the problem of not being able to correctly bind
           a function key to a decoration point such as the title-bar.
	   This involved moving the XGrabKey() grabs from the
	   decorations/windows to the frame, and then fixing up
	   GetContext to recognize the subwindow field of the xkey
	   events.
	2. Fixed the Fvwm Internal Errors found when de-iconifying windows
	   These were caused by doing a deferExecution on an icon window
	   and trying to unset the keyboard focus before grabbing the
	   keyboard, andthen restoring it later. The error was in trying to
           restore the focus to the application window instead of the icon
	   Create functions GrabEm and UngrabEm to handle moving the
	   keyboard focus, grabbing the pointer and keyboard, and then 
           ungrabbing/re-focusing later.
	3. In HandleEnterNotify, decided to detect entering the root window,
	   because we sometimes can leave a window without it being 
           detected by HandleEnterNotify. This was related to pop-up
	   menus in window title-bars.
	4. Fixed a small error in add_window() which caused completely
           undecorated windows to be made one pixel taller than they should be.
	5. Moved click to focus code in HandleButtonPress() to
	   the very start of the routine, since it would lock up
           the WM when pressing button 2 in a window otherwise.
	6. Swapped order of UngrabEm and XUnmapWIndow in PopDownMenu()
	   so that focus is not lost when using keyboard shortcut menus
	   <alt-F2>, for example, in a window.
	7. Added a DefaultIcon enable by adding a line
	   Icon "" my-favorite-bitmap-or-pixmap.
	8. Bottom and Right sides of shaped titled windows were
           colored with the border shadow color. Fixed it.
	9. Added user selectable title bar button decoration shapes.
       10. Added an AnyModifier modifier type, and an AnyButton button type.
       11. With RandomPlacement, we didn't GrabServer before adding a new
	   window so it was possible to get an decoration with no
           window. Fixed this. Also made GrabEm() fail after 1 second,
	   and provided appropriate handling for all routines that
           call it. Thus if we need to grab the pointer, and fail after
           1 second, then we give up.
       12. Added a WaitForButtonsUp() routine which hangs around until all
           mouse buttons are up, then double checks on window focus
	   (for point-to-focus mode). This is called on termination of
           any menu for function execution.
       13. Added a WindowList function like TwmWindows. Required some
	   menu-drawing upgrades.
       14. Added a SuppressIcons to use in conjunction with the WindowList
           for people who like icon-managers.
       15. Gave Maximize some optional arguments to control which directions
           are maximized.
       16. Utilize the WindowList mods to menus to provide 2-column
           menu entries (For shortcut labelling). This also provides for
	   left adjusted menus.
       17. Made the restart do a conventional restart if the restart
           into another program failed.      
       18. Added a CursorMove function to aid in mouseless use.
       19. Changed icon windows to two part windows with the label window
           seperate from the bitmap window. This improves appearance of
           icons when the label size does not match the bitmap size. Also
           label window width is now equal to bitmap window width unless the 
	   icon has the input focus. This should improve auto-placement.
       20. Added some input focus queue code for click to focus mode.
       21. Move button grabs in click-to-focus mode to the frame because
	   otherwise frame-maker crashes sometimes.
       22. Fixed a problem of a failed attempt to bind Alt+button2
           to resize in a window.
       23. Modified use of tolower() in configure.c to be compatible
	   with some BSD versions.
       24. Cleaned up the shaped window handling a little, because
	   xlogo -shape came out wrong.
       25. Added the Function built-in.	Removed the raise-on-click
           behaviour for move and resize builtins too.
       26. Changed zombie handling code to a simple
	   signal(SIGCHLD,SIG_IGN). Seems to work. Old method
	   caused problems for HP-UX.
       27. Added AutoRaise with user selectable delay.

Bugs:
Should re-parent undecorated windows because of the button/key grabbing
problems

****************************************************************************

From 0.95 to 0.96
	1. Changed #ifdef SYSV to #ifdef POSIX for ReapChildren
	2. Divided the NoTitle option into separate 
	   NoTitle and NoBorder options. This eliminated
	   a lot of the #ifdef SHAPE sections and cleaned up
	   code a little.
	3. Took another whack at getting windows to stay put
	   through the re-start command. This time, I tried doing
           it by measuring window placement before re-parenting
	   and after, to get the delta	
	4. Took a patch from davem@extro.ucc.su.OZ.AU to
	   make color XPM icons into shaped icons if
	   both SHAPE and COLOR are specified in the makefile.
	   Diffs were pretty much limited to icons.c.
	5. Allowed icon windows to take input focus so that
           keyboard key binds would work in icon windows. Involved
	   minor changes in events.c and borders.c
	6. Attempted to switch from using if(tmp_win->title_w)
	   and if(tmp_win->title_height) to using just
           if(tmp_win->flags & TITLE). Required for splitting
	   the NoTitle option into NoTitle and NoBorder.
	7. Fixed a small bug with icon AutoPlacement, reported long
	   ago but just identified. AutoPlacement wanted five pixels
	   space on all sides of the icon EVEN IF IT WAS ON THE NEXT
	   PAGE. Oops. Should be fixed.
	8. Replaced usleep() call with a subroutine that should be
	   OK for more systems, using select(). Thanks to krumnow@sap-ag.de
	9. Fixed a problem with fvwm reporting stray mouse-button releases
	   to applications. This was caused by de-iconifying on a
           button press in the icon window. If the window appears under
           the icon, it receives the release event. Caused xmeter to croak.
       10. Fixed a problem where you could move a window over a page
	   boundary, release the mouse button, move the mouse really
	   fast, and the window would show up in the wrong place.
	   Change was limited to move.c. Added an extra XQueryPointer()
	   call.
       11. Move the ExececuteFunction() call from menus.c to functions.c
	   where it really belonged. Along the way, caused the pointer to
           warp back to its pre-menu popup location when a resize operation
           is invoker. The move operation has always worked this way.
       12. Fixed an error in parsing Key bindings for Restart and
	   Exec functions.
       13. Re-wrote the pager so that you could move windows using it,
	   and could select the focus in click-to-focus mode.
       14. Added a Maximize function.
       15. Added a user-selectable number of title-bar buttons.
       16. When trying to grab the pointer for whatever reason,
	   added a 1 msec delay between events, and give up after
           1 second. If some other window has a grab on the pointer,
	   we don't want to lock up the whole system just
	   because we want the pointer.

0.96 Known Unresolved bugs:
1. Keyboard keys can't be bound to actions in the window decorations.

2. Fvwm crashes occasionally? One report, involving Ftptool 4.5,
   could not be re-created by me.
