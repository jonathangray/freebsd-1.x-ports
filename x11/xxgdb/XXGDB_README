XXGDB version 1.06
------------------

	>> SEE ALSO XDBX DOCUMENTATION <<
	>> SEE ALSO xxgdb.man DOCUMENTATION <<
	
	XXGDB is a X window interface to the GDB debugger.
	
	GDB must be accessible in the current path.
	
	xxgdb should run the new gdb 4.0 (as well as the older versions).
	
	This X window interface has been adapted to GDB from the source
	distribution files of XDBX version 2.1 (patch level 2) which
	implements an X window interface to the DBX debugger.
	
	See the XDBX_README file for more information on XDBX.
	
	XXGDB has been originally tested on SUN 4 running OS 4.1.
	It should also run on SUN OS3.
	
    Also, any System V should be able to build by setting the -DSYSV flag.
    SCO Unix also requires the -Dsco flag. Bull DPX/2 [23]00 requires the
    -Dncl_mr flag as well as -DSYSV. Some systems may also need to set
    -DUSG to use the GNU malloc instead of the native one. The GNU malloc
    works much quicker and is much more reliable. SCO Unix requires GNU
    malloc to work correctly. GNU malloc is not provided here, you should
    get malloc.c and getpagesize.h from the source of gdb.

    Also note that if building on SCO you must also link with -lsocket
    and if building on DPX/2 you must also link with -linet. You will need
    the R4 release of X11 for both.
			
	- XXGDB changes the GDB default 'set prettyprint' to ON (or 'set
	p pretty' if gdb 4.0). This is necessary to be able to display
	the pointed object when clicking a pointer value in a popup window
	(see also 'Displaying C Data Structures' in xdbx documentation).
	Except for this feature, xxgdb works with 'set prettyprint off'.
	
	- XXGDB changes the GDB default 'set screensize' to 0 (or
	'set height' and 'set width' to 0 if gdb 4.0).

	- XXGDB changes the GDB default 'set confirm' to off (if gdb 4.0).
	THIS IS IMPORTANT. DO NOT SET CONFIRM TO OFF OR XXGDB MIGHT HANG.

	- With the 'list' command, XXGDB will put the cursor at the last 
	listed line and will make sure that this last line is visible
	in the source window.
	
	- The file button will execute 'core-file <filename>' if the file
	is named 'core', 'list <filename>:1' if the file is not executable
	and 'exec-file <filename> symbol-file <filename> if the file
	is executable. Executable files are displayed with a trailing '*'
	character.
	
	- For systems which do not have the ANSI strstr function in their
	library, one is included in gdb_parser.c and is compiled if NEED_STRSTR
	is defined.
	
	- if you define UNDISPWIN when compiling, then the display window
	will disappear when there is nothing to display.
	(eg, add -DUNDISPWIN in DEFGDB definition in Imakefile).
	See display_info_handler function in gdb_handler.c
	
	- Copy the application default file (XDbx.ad) into your home
	directory or into the X '/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults' directory
	(eg, 'cp -p XDbx.ad ~/XDbx').
	
	- The name of the debugger called by xxgdb is by default 'gdb'.
	It can be overridden with the environment variable XXGDB_DEBUGGER.
	
	- DO NOT modify the gdb prompt (using the 'set prompt' command).
	XXGDB assumes that the gdb prompt is 'gdb' or the XXGDB_DEBUGGER
	environment variable if defined.
	
	There are two new application resources and command line args:
   	 - db_name can be used to specify the name of the debugger to
     override the default "gdb" (instead of using an env. variable).
     - db_prompt can be used to specify to xgdb the string to be used by
     the debugger as a prompt.  The default is to expect the prompt
     used by the debugger to be the name of the debugger enclosed in
     parenthesis.   This is no good for gdbvx, which expects a prompt
     of (gdb).


	To build xxgdb, 'Imakefile' defines :
	
#define TARGET_IS_GDB 1


XXGDB version BUG LIST
----------------------

This version of XXGDB is pretty much working. 
The following bugs will probably be fixed in future versions.

	- 'define' command of GDB is not completely supported by xxgdb
		because xxgdb does not interpret what the defined commands
		do.
		
	- 'set confirm off' might hang xxgdb later on.
	
	- 'source' command of XXGDB behaves slighlty differently from 
	the one in GDB. The specified file is read line by line by xxgdb
	and each line is sent to gdb. Thus gdb will ask confirmation of
	some commands (except for gdb 4.0 because of 'set confirm off'
	used by xxgdb).
	This is also the case for the execution of the '.gdbinit' file.
	
	- Repeat command of XXGDB behaves slighlty differently from the one
	in GDB.
