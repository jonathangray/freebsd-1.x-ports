This is an experimental version of tvtwm with pie menus.

Pie menu tracking (optimized for speed) and layout (optimized for
screen space) designed and implemented by Don Hopkins.
These algorithms are not patented or restricted.  Feel free to 
use and improve upon them.

The rest of this file is the standard tvtwm README. 
I haven't documented the pie menu changes yet, 
but you can look in system.uwmrc to see how to define your own. 

Oh by the way, I've added support for pixmap pie menu labels.
Just use a menu label that begins with an underscore followed by 
the name of a pixmap, using the normal pixmap naming conventions.

Also I fixed a bug using xpm with multi headed servers.  The code needed
to pass in an attribute structure to the xpm library describing the 
appropriate visual and colormap, since xbm would otherwise use the
default visual on the default screen (which was wrong for one of them).

========================================================================

  Welcome to tvtwm.  This code is a derivation off of MIT's X11 twm
program.  For those of your who are used to twm, this should be an
easy transition, that has *much* to offer you.  This README file
will mainly outline the differences between tvtwm, and other
windows managers.  As well as a detail about what makes this release
different from past releases of tvtwm.

  The first section below, was written by Tom LaStrange, the author
of this code as I first started with it.  The section below his, is
a list and decription of the changes that have been made to tvtwm
since I've been hacking on it.

For those of you like me who want to try software before reading
the instructions, all you have to do to get started is add a single
line to your .twmrc file.  Something like this:

  VirtualDesktop "3000x2000"

Now for the verbose description:

This is yet another, different implementation of the Virtual Desktop
concept for twm.  I call this version tvtwm (Tom's Virtual twm).  It is
based on the R4 version of twm with up to fix-14 installed.  This
implementation is modeled after swm (Solbourne Window Manager) and
includes the very nice ability to move windows into and out of the
panner.  It should be noted that none of this code came from the vtwm
implementation.  If you have problems and/or patches you can email me
at the address at the end of this file.

If we look at different implementations of the Virtual Desktop, I think
we can relate them to soft drinks:

swm   - Classic Coke  "The Real Thing"
tvtwm - Diet Coke     "Same as Coke but not as sweet"
vtwm  - Diet Pepsi    "Not as sweet as Coke, some people may
		       prefer it to any flavor of Coke"

There are pros and cons to the vtwm and swm/tvtwm implementations.  Most
revolve around whether or not to use an additional window for the
scrolling desktop or to simply move windows around on the actual
root window.

vtwm moves windows on the actual root window, swm/tvtwm use an
additional window to perform the scrolling.

Pros:
  vtwm    Simple to implement.
          Programs like xsetroot continue to work.

  tvtwm   Half the network traffic when the desktop scrolls,
	    only a ConfigureNotify event has to be sent.
	  Faster scrolling of the desktop.
	  Desktop background image will actually scroll.
	  Opens the door for possible multiple Virtual Desktop
	    windows.
Cons:
  vtwm	  Twice as much network traffic when the desktop scrolls,
	    each window has to be moved and then a ConfigureNotify
	    event must be sent.
	  Slower scrolling of the desktop.
	  Desktop background image does not scroll.

  tvtwm	  Programs like xsetroot no longer work, additional work
	    needs to be done to find the Virtual Desktop window.
	  Programs that attempt to find the size of the window
	    manager decoration may fail if the traverse the window
	    tree until they run into the actual root window.

The ICCCM states that more work needs to be done in the area of
virtual root windows, so there isn't any clear answer on the right
way to implement this feature.  Having said that, let me describe
how I've butchered the code, what currently doesn't work, what would
be nice if it worked, etc.

1. First a description of how the panner works.  Basically,
   mouse button 1 allows you to change your position in the
   desktop.  Mouse button 2 allows you to drag any of the
   small "virtual" windows.  During a window move operation
   you can move the pointer into and out of the panner.
   Resizing the panner will of course resize the desktop.

2. I completely re-wrote the window move code.  In menus.c I 
   simply commented out the window move code that is there and
   didn't touch any code related to window moves in events.c.
   The new window move code is in a new file called move.c.

3. Rather than the f.nail and "NailedDown" features of vtwm, tvtwm
   uses the same terminology as swm.  In tvtwm, windows that do
   not move when the desktop is panned are called "sticky" windows.
   There is a command called f.stick and a "Sticky" list of windows
   that will be sticky when started.  Sticky windows used to always
   be physically above non-sticky windows.  This is no longer the case 
   but if you have gotten used to it, you can place the "StickyAbove"
   keyword in your .{tv}twmrc file.  The sticky-ness of a window is
   remembered during an f.restart if RestartPreviousState is set.

4. USPosition vs. PPosition - When a window has USPosition hints
   set, the window will be positioned at that exact pixel location.
   When PPosition hints are set, the window will be positioned at 
   the pixel location plus the current offset of the Virtual Desktop.
   For example, if the desktop has been panned to +200+500 and 
   a window is mapped with PPosition +100+100, the window will be
   positioned at +300+600 on the desktop.

5. How does the icon gravity stuff work in relation to different areas
   of the Virtual Desktop?  I don't know, and I don't really have the
   time to look into the problem.  It might be nice to have separate icon
   regions in different quadrants of the Virtual Desktop.  If you use
   icon managers and make them sticky then you don't have any problems.

6. The initialization files .tvtwmrc.<screen number> and .tvtwmrc will
   be attempted before .twmrc.<screen number> .twmrc.


New Variables:

VirtualDesktop "WIDTHxHEIGHT"
  This variable simply specified the initial size of the Virtual Desktop.
  Specifying this variable enables the Virtual Desktop feature.
  Why didn't I use the same syntax as vtwm and also specify the panner
  scale and geometry?  I don't know, lazy I guess.

VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap "filename"
  The pixmap image to display as the background of the Virtual Desktop window.

VirtualDesktopBackground "color"
  The background color of the VirtualDesktop window.  If
  VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap is not set, the VirtualDesktop will have a
  solid background of this color.

VirtualDesktopForeground "color"
  This color is only used if VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap is set.

VirtualForeground "color" [ { window list } ]
  Specifies the foreground color for the small virtual panner windows.

VirtualBackground "color" [ { window list } ]
  Specifies the background color for the small virtual panner windows.

VirtualFont "5x8"
  The font to use when ShowVirtualNames is specified.

ShowVirtualNames
  This causes the window name to be displayed in the small virtual
  panner window.  The VirtualFont is used to display the name.

PannerGeometry "+-X+-Y"
  Specifies the geometry at which the panner is to be placed.  The
  default is "-0-0".

PannerState "state"
  This specifies the initial state of the panner.  Possible values
  include "withdrawn", "iconic", and "normal".  The default state
  is "normal".

PannerScale scale
  This specifies the scale of the panner.  The default number is 20.

PannerBackgroundPixmap "filename"
  The pixmap image to display as the background of the panner window.

PannerBackground "color"
  The background color of the panner window.  If PannerBackgroundPixmap
  is not set, the panner will have a solid background of this color.

PannerForeground "color"
  This color is only used if PannerBackgroundPixmap is set.

ScrollDistanceX	percentage
ScrollDistanceY percentage
  The percentage of the display width/height to move for the f.scroll
  commands

Sticky { window list }
  A list of windows that will come up in a sticky state.

StickyAbove
  Causes sticky windows to always be physically above non-sticky windows.

NoIconTitle [ { window list } ]
  Specifies that no titles should be displayed below icons.  If the
  optional window list is present then only those clients will
  not have icon titles.

IconTitle { window list }
  Specifies a list of clients that will have icon titles.  Useful
  when NoIconTitle has been specified alone.

New Commands:

f.panner		- toggle making the panner visible
f.scroll "position"	- scroll to a specific position
f.scrollhome		- scroll the desktop to 0,0
f.scrollup		- scroll the desktop up ScrollDistanceY
f.scrolldown		- scroll the desktop down ScrollDistanceY
f.scrollleft		- scroll the desktop left ScrollDistanceX
f.scrollright		- scroll the desktop right ScrollDistanceX
f.scrollback		- scroll back to the previous location
f.panup			- same as f.scrollup
f.pandown		- same as f.scrolldown
f.panleft		- same as f.scrollleft
f.panright		- same as f.scrollright
f.stick			- toggle making a window sticky or not


A version of xsetroot, called ssetroot has been included as an
example of how to find the Virtual Desktop window.

Things not added by Tom, bugs in them aren't his fault:

Shaped Icons:

  There are two implementations of icon shaping in this release of tvtwm.
I will explain them both in this section, though the second is *much*
easier to comprehend, and I advise ignoring the first icon-shaping
description.  Though both are active in the code, and functional, the
existence of the built-in shaping in Xpm format pixmaps makes that
the obviously simpler way to do things.  I have added this code, so that
Xpm format pixmaps with built-in shape masks work, but have yet to remove
the old code for shaped icons, as described in the next paragraph.
	*** Important!! ***
  I *do* intend to remove this code.  You can, if you want, utilize this
form of icon-shaping, but later releases of tvtwm will likely not continue
to support it.

(Old, 3-bitmap, method):
  Shaped icons have 3 parts, one of which is optional.  The first part is
the image.  It is a normal icon, so you can use any of the ones you had all
along.  The second part is the clip.  tvtwm will look for a file of the
format "<filename>clp" where <filename> is the name of the bitmap to be
used as an icon.  A file followed by "clp" is a clip file for that icon.
In this file, if a pixel is "on", the pixels in the image will be taken;
and where the pixel is "off", the pixels from the mask (described below)
will be placed.  The third and optional part is the mask.  Masks are
searched for in the bitmapFilePath, as are the clip files, and are found by
the iconname plus "msk".  Pixels set to "on" in the mask and "off" in the
clip are drawn in the IconBorderColor, pixels set to "off" in the mask and
"on" in the clip are "holes" (whatever is under the icon will show through,
and button presses there will go to the window under the icon (normally the
root window)).  The setting of a mask pixel where that clip pixel is "on"
is ignored.  If you don't give a mask, one will be created for temporary
use.  The mask that tvtwm creates will be two pixels wider then the clip
(i.e. a two pixel border).  It is often easier to let tvtwm generate the
mask file, but that is up to your personal preference, and to the specific
icon in question.  All 3 parts must be bitmaps of the same height and width
(even if the mask is automagicly created, it will not be created larger
then the other two parts).

(New, better, shaped Xpm method):
  The current version of the Xpm library supports built-in shape masks.
For a detailed description of how XPM works, please look at the
documentation provided with Xpm.  Xpm should be available in it's current
form (which is required for this release of tvtwm.  Version 3.0 (4-Oct-91)
or higher.) on the R5 contrib tape, or if it's not, it can be obtained at
either export.lcs.mit.edu or avahi.inria.fr.  To detail how to use Xpm's
built in shaping support, I will tell you the little you need to know in
particular.  If you have an xpm format pixmap file in a directory which is
in your *bitmapFilePath X resource, then you can simply load the pixmap as
"filename", just as you are used to doing with Xbm format bitmaps.  If the
file you specify can be found, and is a valid Xpm format file, then it will
be read.  If you have pixels in the pixmap defined as color "None", then a
shape mask will be returned by the Xpm read functions, and tvtwm will use
such a returned mask as an icon shape-mask.  The result of which, is shaped
icons.  I will provide a few Xpm format icons in the icons/ directory.  If
you simply move one or more of these files into a directory which is an
element of your *bitmapFilePath, then specify them as icons in your .twmrc
file, you can see for yourself how they work.  Also, I will include a
couple sample titlebar button Xpm pixmaps.  These are all pixmaps which I
use regularly, and have grown fond of.  I hope you find them as enjoyable.

M4:

  Your .twmrc file is fed to m4 before being parsed by tvtwm.  Taking this
approach to configuration is useful for keeping centrally maintained menus,
making your setup work regardless of variables such as display size, and
(though not at the moment) controlling who sees what of the .twmrc setup
files.  To help you make use of m4, and to give you something to program
around, the following symbols are defined by tvtwm:

  SERVERHOST, CLIENTHOST, HOSTNAME, USER, HOME, VERSION, REVISION,
  VENDOR, RELEASE, WIDTH, HEIGHT, X_RESOLUTION, Y_RESOLUTION, 
  PLANES, BITS_PER_RGB, TWM_TYPE, CLASS, and COLOR.

  For detailed explanations of what each of the above declarations is
useful for, and what they are set to, look under M4 PREPROCESSING in the
man page.

Useful tricks with M4:

# Use different pictures on color and black & white screen:
ifelse(PLANES, 1, `
VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap  "/homes/elves/lib/rasters/space.rast"
PannerBackgroundPixmap "/homes/elves/lib/rasters/space2.xbm"',
`VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap  "/homes/elves/lib/rasters/space.color.gif"
PannerBackgroundPixmap "/homes/elves/lib/rasters/space2.xpm"')

# Centrally maintained menus:
include(/local/skel/X/twm-logins)

# Place icons on the lower half and right third of the screen:
define(IRegion, translit(eval(WIDTH/3)*eval(HEIGHT/2)+eval(WIDTH-WIDTH/3)-0, *, x))
IconRegion  "IRegion" SOUTH EAST 75 25

# Create menus on the fly (possibly dependent on machine, lab, or arch):
define(`TMPFILE', maketemp(`/tmp/twigm4XXXXXX'))
syscmd(`sh /local/software/bin/twig.twm.sh >' TMPFILE)
menu "Automagic"
{
"Magic" ("ivory1":"ivory4") f.title
include(TMPFILE)
syscmd(`rm' TMPFILE)
}

# Capitalize host name for use in window titles:
define(LOWER_CASE,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz)
define(UPPER_CASE,ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ)
"New Window"                    !"xterm -geometry 80x24 -T 'translit(substr(SERV
ERHOST,0,1),LOWER_CASE,UPPER_CASE)`'substr(SERVERHOST,1)' &"


XPM Support:

  This version of tvtwm has support for X Pixmaps.  By using X Pixmaps, you
can get multi-color (meaning more than just the foreground and background
colors.  I personally have some 16 or 32 color icons now...) icons,
titlebar buttons, and panner backgrounds.  This code is conditional.  If
you simply comment out the two lines in the Imakefile which set the -DXPM
and the location for the Xpm library, it will compile cleanly without
support for Xpm's.  To get this support, you must have the header file and
library for Xpm.  This release of tvtwm needs Xpm v3.0 (4-Oct-91) or
higher, which can be found on the R5 contrib tape, or can be obtained via
anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu or avahi.inria.fr.  Once you have
this installed on you system, you can use the Xpm code.  When running tvtwm
with Xpm support, tvtwm will search along bitmapFilePath (defined in your
.Xdefaults) for Xpm pixmaps.  (Note:  tvtwm will *not* load Xpm version 1
pixmaps, or version 2 pixmaps other than C format.  What the Xpm library
will and won't load is not up to me, and may change.  I suggest trying to
use strictly XPM v3 format pixmaps.  If you have other versions, there are
converter scripts available.)  When it finds a bitmap/pixmap with the
correct file name, it will try to load it as an Xpm.  If this fails, it
will attempt to load the same file as a standard bitmap.  So, you can keep
bitmaps and they will work just as well as they have in previous versions
of tvtwm, but if you choose to, you can switch them to pixmaps.  Both will
work.  As is, it does a fairly good job of falling back to reading it as an
xbm file.

  Right now, tvtwm is modified to use either pixmaps or bitmaps for icons,
titlebar menu buttons, or the background of the panner window.  And,
actually, there is Xpm code for loading the VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap,
too, but assuming you use the XLOADIMAGE def (explained below), I don't
think you'll ever care that the Xpm code is there.  It will only get
compiled if notdef XLOADIMAGE.  In theory, there could be code added to
display pixmaps in other places as well, but we didn't see anything else
that needed it.  I hope to be adding it to the pullright pixmap soon, and
maybe in a couple of the built-in pixmaps, but I'm not sure there is reason
for it.  If anyone has any suggestions, please feel free to mail me and let
me know.

Xloadimage for desktop background:

  I have modified tvtwm slightly so that if you choose to compile it to do
so (which I recomment heartily), it will fork() and exec() the xloadimage
program (written by Jim Frost  <jimf@saber.com>).  Tvtwm creates a
"virtual" root window over top of the real root window, and the will load a
bitmap onto it automatically.  With this modification, you can now specify
VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap to be an image of nearly any format.  Any
format that xloadimage supports.  xloadimage can load gif's, rasterfiles,
xbm's, and many other common graphic types.  This makes it much easier to
load a colorful or large file, and have it be stored in the smallest
possible format, as xloadimage also knows how to load compressed (.Z)
files.

  xloadimage is available from export.lcs.mit.edu and most other common ftp
sites.  It may well be on the R5 contrib tape, but I am not sure of this.

  Side note:  With tvtwm createing it's "virtual" root window, many
programs that try to look for the root window (editres, xwd, xsetroot) will
not work as expected.  To fix many of these problems, there is a vroot.h
header file that has been made available by Andreas Stolcke
<stolcke@ICSI.Berkeley.EDU>, which redefines all of the standard X macros
for the root window (RootWindow(), RootWindowOfScreen(), and
DefaultRootWindow()).  Most programs can be fixed by including the header
file after Xlib.h in the source code.  As for xsetroot, there is a program
named ssetroot which is included with this distribution which is a complete
superset of xsetroot.  If you would like to do so, you can uncomment the
line in the Imakefile that instructs the make to install this program over
top of your xsetroot program.  In most cases, this is advised.  There is
little or no reason to keep both copies.

New Functions:

  In this version of tvtwm, there are also a few extra functions.  Most
of these are simply override options, to perform a function without
having to explicitly ask for it.  For example, if you want to assign
a button to perform an opaque move, even if OpaqueMove isn't set, then
you can bind that button to f.opaquemove, instead of f.move.  The new
functions are as follows:

  f.constrainedmove	Does a constrained move without need to double click.

  f.opaquemove		Opaque move even when OpaqueMove is deactivated.

  f.relativeresize	Do a relative resize without need to double click.


  I hope you enjoy tvtwm, and I hope that I have helped in such.  If you
have any questions/comments/etc, please mail me at cross@eng.umd.edu.
Best wishes.
