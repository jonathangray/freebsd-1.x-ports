1.93 to 1.94
	1. Fixed some minor long-standing errors in the vt100 emulation.
	2. Fixed ALT-<char> handling in command.c
	3. Fixed minor bug with start-of-selection location.
	4. Added xterm-type "extend selection" feature using
	   mouse button 3. Button 1 always starts a new selection. Button3
	   tries to extend the current selection if possible.
	5. Fixed problem with bold-face fonts overflowing into
	   the next character for some fonts.

1.92 to 1.93
	1. ran gprof to find bottle-necks in the code. Halved user
	   time, but had little effect on total time required to
	   update the display. Seems worth keeping for the more efficient
	   user-time, though. At this point, I think that most of the elapsed
	   time is spent waiting for input or waiting for the X buffers
	   to flush.
	2. Used to refresh the screen every 2.2 screen-fulls during
	   flat-out scrolling. Really cuts down on scroll-time. Now,
	   refresh every screen-full (or when there's a pause in activity),
	   but when flat-out scrolling starts, decrease the refresh period,
	   so that its every 10th screenful after a little while. This has
	   no noticeable visible effect, since the scrolling text is
	   absolutely unintelligible anyway, but will improve the scroll
	   "feel" when doing just one or two screenfulls, ie in an ls -l.
	3. Surrounded  the code which uses XCopyArea with #ifdef's
	   I have never seen this help performance, but I think that there
	   may be some video-systems which benefit from this, particularly
	   in a full-screen editor or slow scrolling type of setting.
	4. Performance in flat out scrolling, text only, on a sparc-10,
	   displaying rxvt on an HDS x-terminal:
		nation@snoopy>/usr/bin/time rxvt -e cat k
		        6.1 real         3.1 user         2.5 sys
		nation@snoopy>/usr/bin/time xterm -e cat k
		       40.8 real         4.6 user         3.4 sys

1.91 to 1.92
	1. Added greek-keyboard support patches.
1.90 to 1.91
	1. assorted minor patches
1.85 to 1.90 
	1. assorted minor patches
1.82 to 1.85
	1. Fixed ESC c handling.
	2. Fixed minor selection handling bug.

1.81 to 1.82
	1. Fixed slow refresh during selection process
	2. Fixed problem of not correctly clearing selections of
	   1 character.

1.80 to 1.81
	1. Fixed some scrolling problems, problems with
	   partially obscured windows.
        2. Added some neat debugging capability in debug.c
        3. Patched up rclock.

1.74 to 1.80

	1. Fixed core dump from selecting past the bottom of the screen
	2. Fixed a few escape sequences, per the vttest program
	3. Broke and fixed handling of moved/resize/new-font handling.
	4. Still can't change tab stops correctly.
        5. Ran vt-100 test suite. Added capability to change tab stops
	   and enter reverse video, and to switch from 80 to 132
	   columns and back. Fixed a seg-fault in scroll().

	
1.70 to 1.74
	1. Fixed cursor drawing errors.
	2. Improved smoothness of scroll-back operations.
	3. Applied some SVR4 patches.
	4. Applied HPUX patches, and a few cursor display patches
	5. Fixed up font-changing routines a bit.
	6. Fixed a scrolling problem for windows taller than the scroll-back
	   buffer.

1.6 to 1.7
        1. Fixed the problem with random rendition flags in the scroll
	   back buffer
	2. Fiddled with re-drawing on the scroll-bar, and with
	   how often refreshing occurs.
	3. Incorporated some AIX patches.
	4. Included #ifdef'd changes to support vt100 printer.
        5. Fixed send_string routine, so that it doesn't loose
	   data.
	6. Complete re-write of screen.c
1.5 to 1.6
	1. Removed all use of a seperate bold font. Now uses
	   over-striking exclusively.
	2. Added some more optimizations for drawing speed when
	   the window is re-sized or moved.
        3. Implemented speed ups in screen.c

1.47 to 1.48
	1. Cleaned up re-drawing on expose events, so rxvt only
	   re-draws the newly exposed parts of the screen.
        2. Fixed backspace, which must have broken in 1.45.
	3. Added command line option of iconic startup.

from 1.45 to 1.47
	1. Incorporated improved bsd utmp handling from 
           dperry@ringer.cs.utsa.edu (David Perry)
	2. Fixed a very minor bug where the solid-cursor can leave a
	   a bit of a ghost when you resize the window. Its stupid,
	   but it always bothered me.

from 1.4 to 1.45

	1.  Fixed scrolling error when switching to larger fonts
	2.  Fixed utmp-entry removal for SYSV type systems.
	3.  Icorportated patches for FreeBSD and svr4
