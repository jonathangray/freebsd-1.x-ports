.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBblt_graph\fR command creates a new window (given by the 
\fIpathName\fR argument) and makes it into an graph widget.
Additional
options, described above, may be specified on the command line
or in the option database
to configure aspects of the graph such as its colors and font.
The \fBblt_graph\fR command returns its
\fIpathName\fR argument.  At the time this command is invoked,
there must not exist a window named \fIpathName\fR, but
\fIpathName\fR's parent must exist.
.PP
The \fBblt_graph\fR widget plots two-variable data in a window.  
It has of several components; coordinate axes, 
crosshairs, a legend, and a collection of elements and tags.
.SS "COORDINATE AXES"
The graph widget has four axes, two standard (x and y) and two alternate
(x2 and y2).  Graph elements and tags are mapped onto one x-axis and 
y-axis (by default, they are mapped onto the standard axes).
.PP
Each axis consists of the axis line and major and minor 
ticks placed at set intervals. At major ticks, labels (text strings) 
representing the coordinate value of the tick are drawn.  
By default, the tick labels are simply numeric strings.  However, 
a Tcl procedure can be supplied to individually format each 
tick label.
.PP
The scale of the axis is determined its minimum and maximum limits.
By default, each axis is auto-scaled using the data limits.
However either limit can be set to manually scale the graph.
.SS "CROSSHAIRS"
Crosshairs are a set of two lines (vertical and horizontal) which
intersect on the graph.  They are implemented using XOR drawing
primitives, so they do not require the graph to be redrawn when 
they are moved or redisplayed.
.SS "ELEMENTS"
A graph element is a set of data points and configuration options 
which determine how the data is displayed.  Elements are created 
by the \fBelement create\fP widget command.  The configuration options may 
be specified as the element is created or later by the \fBelement configure\fR 
widget command.  There is an internal display list of element names which 
controls the drawing order of the elements. By default, elements are 
appended to the display list as they are created.  The element display list
can be managed by the \fBelement show\fR command.  
.SS "LEGEND"
The legend consists of a list of entries, where each entry is an element
symbol and label.  By default, the legend is located in the right
margin of the graph.  However, the legend may appear anywhere in the
plotting area of the graph by specifying its window coordinates.
.SS "TAGS"
Tags are simple drawing procedures used to annotate or highlight
areas of the graph. A tag may be either a text string, bitmap,
line, window, or polygon.  A tag may be associated with a particular 
element, so that the tag is displayed only if the element is 
displayed.  Tags are the first items drawn when the graph is displayed, 
so that elements, symbols, legend, and axes always appear in front of them.  
.PP
Tags differ from elements in that they do not affect the auto-scaling of 
coordinate axes.  Furthermore, tags can have \fIelastic\fR coordinates
(specified by \fC-Inf\fR and \fCInf\fR respectively) which translate into
the axis minimum or maximum limit.  For example, to place a tag so it
always remains in the lower left corner of the plot, use the coordinates
\fC-Inf\fR,\fC-Inf\fR.
.SH "WIDGET COMMANDS"
.PP
The \fBblt_graph\fR command creates a new Tcl command whose
name is \fIpathName\fR.  This
command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget.  It has the general form:
.DS C
\fIpathName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.DE
\fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following
commands are valid for \fBblt_graph\fR widgets:
.TP
\fIpathName \fBconfigure \fR?\fIoptions...\fR?
Queries or modifies the configuration options of the widget. 
Valids options are described in
.SB WIDGET OPTIONS.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBcrosshairs configure\fR ?\fIoptions...\fR?
Queries or modifies the configuration options of the crosshairs.
This command is similar to the \fBconfigure\fR command, except that it
applies to the options of the crosshairs, whereas \fBconfigure\fR applies 
to the options for the graph as a whole.  See
.SB CROSSHAIRS OPTIONS
for a description of valid options.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBcrosshairs toggle\fR
Toggles the current state of the crosshairs, turning them on or off.
This command returns an empty string.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBelement activate \fIname \fR?\fIindex...?\fR
Specifies which data points of element \fIname\fR are to be drawn 
using active foreground and background colors.  \fIName\fR is the name
of the element and \fIindex\fR is a number representing the index of 
the data point. If no indices are present then all data points become 
active.  This command returns the empty string.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBelement append \fIname coords\fR
Appends pairs of x,y data points to element \fIname\fR.  
\fIcoords\fR is a list of numeric expressions (x,y graph coordinates) 
representing data points.  It returns the empty string.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBelement closest \fIwinX winY ?name...?\fR
Finds the data point closest to the window coordinates \fIwinX\fR and 
\fIwinY\fR in the element \fIname\fR.  It returns a list containing the 
name of the closest element, the index of its closest point, 
and the graph x,y coordinates of the point.  If no data point
within a threshold distance can be found (see the \fB-halo\fR option), 
then the empty list is returned.  \fIName\fR is the name of an 
element, which must be mapped.  If no elements are specified, then
all mapped elements are searched.  
.TP
\fIpathName \fBelement configure \fIname \fR?\fIoptions...\fR?
This command is similar to the \fBconfigure\fR command, except that it
applies to the options of an individual element, whereas
\fBconfigure\fR applies to the options for the graph as a whole.
\fIOptions\fR may have any of the values accepted by the
\fBelement create\fR widget command. See
.SB ELEMENT OPTIONS
for a description of valid options.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBelement create \fIname \fR?\fIoptions...\fR? 
Creates a new element \fIname\fP in the graph.  Element names must be
unique, so \fIname\fR can not already exist in the graph.  
If additional arguments are present, they specify any of the 
element options (see 
.SB ELEMENT OPTIONS
).
.TP
\fIpathName \fBelement deactivate \fIname ?name...?\fR
.VS
Deactivate the named elements.  The elements will be redrawn using
their normal foreground and background colors.  \fIName\fR is the name
of the element. This command returns the empty string.
.VE
.TP
\fIpathName \fBelement delete ?\fIname ...\fR?
Deletes the element \fIname\fR from the graph.  
Returns the empty string.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBelement names\fR
Returns a list of all elements. This differs from
\fBelement show\fR in that it returns the names of all elements, not
just those in the element display list.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBelement show \fR?\fInames\fR?
Queries or resets the element display list.  
The element display
list defines which elements are drawn and in what order.  
\fINames\fR is a list of the elements to
be displayed.  If there is no \fInames\fR argument, the list of elements 
currently being displayed is returned.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBinvtransform \fIwinX winY\fP 
Performs an inverse coordinate transformation, mapping x,y window 
coordinates to graph coordinates (using the standard x and y axes).  
Returns a list of containing the x and y graph coordinates.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBlegend activate \fIname...\fR
.VS
Specifies that the legend entries of the named elements should be drawn 
with the active legend background and foreground colors.  The entries may 
also be drawn with a different relief (using the \fB-activerelief\fR and 
\fB-activeborderwidth\fR options).
\fIName\fR is the name of an element in the graph.
.VE
.TP
\fIpathName \fBlegend configure \fR?\fIoptions...\fR?
This command is similar to the \fBconfigure\fR command, except that it
applies to the options for the legend, whereas \fBconfigure\fR applies
to the options for the graph as a whole.  See 
.SB LEGEND OPTIONS
for a description of valid options.  
.TP
\fIpathName \fBlegend deactivate \fIname...\fR
.VS
Specifies that the legend enties of the named elements should be drawn 
with the legend background and foreground colors.  \fIName\fR is the 
name of an element in the graph.
.VE
.TP
\fIpathName \fBlegend get \fIstring\fR
.VS
Returns the name of the graph element at the current screen position
in the legend.  \fIString\fR must be in the form "\fI@x,y\fR", where 
\fIx\fR and \fIy\fR are the window coordinates.  If the given screen 
coordinates do not lie over a legend entry, the empty string is returned.
.VE
.TP
\fIpathName \fBpostscript \fR?\fIfileName\fR? ?\fIoptions...\fR?
Generates PostScript commands to print the graph. If no \fIfileName\fR
argument is present, the PostScript output is returned. Otherwise,
\fIfileName\fR is created and will contain the PostScript output.  In
this case the empty string is returned.  If any \fIoption-value\fR
pairs are present, they set configuration options controlling how the
PostScript is generated. See 
.SB POSTSCRIPT OPTIONS
for a description of valid options.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBpsconfigure \fR?\fIoptions...\fR?
Queries or modifies the options of the \fBpostscript\fR command.  
See 
.SB POSTSCRIPT OPTIONS
for a description of valid options.  
.TP
\fIpathName \fBtag after \fItagId\fR ?\fItagId\fR?
Reorders the tag display list placing the first tag specified after
the second.  If no second \fItagId\fR argument is specified, the tag
is placed at the end of the list.  This command can be used to control
how tags are displayed since tags are drawn in the order of this
display list.  The empty string is returned.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBtag before \fItagId\fR ?\fItagId\fR?
Reorders the tag display list placing the first tag specified before
the second.  If no second \fItagId\fR argument is specified, the tag
is placed at the beginning of the list.  This command can be used to
control how tags are displayed since tags are drawn in the order of
this display list.  The empty string is returned.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBtag configure \fItagId\fR ?\fIoptions...\fR? 
Queries or modifies the configuration options of the particular tag.
See 
.SB TAG OPTIONS
for a description of valid options.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBtag coords \fItagId\fR ?\fIcoords\fR? 
Queries or resets the coordinates of the tag designated by
\fItagId\fR.  If \fIcoords\fR is present, it is a list of coordinate pairs
representing the points of the tag.  This list is used to re-position the tag.
If the \fIcoords\fR argument is not present, the current list of
coordinates for \fItagId\fR is returned.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBtag create \fItype\fR ?\fIcoords\fR? ?\fIoptions...\fR?
Creates a tag of the selected type. \fIType\fR may be either

.SH "CONFIGURATION OPTIONS"
.SS "WIDGET OPTIONS"
The following widget options are valid for the \fBconfigure\fR command.  
.DS
\fIpathName \fBconfigure\fR ?\fIoption\fR? ?\fIvalue option value ...\fR?
.DE
The \fBconfigure\fR command queries or modifies the configuration options 
of the widget.  If no \fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list 
describing all of the
available options for \fIpathName\fR (see \fBTk_ConfigureInfo\fR for
information on the format of this list).  
If \fIoption\fR is specified with no \fIvalue\fR, then the command 
returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be 
identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if 
no \fIoption\fR is specified).  If one or more \fIoption\-value\fR 
pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in
this case the command returns the empty string.  
.TP
\fB\-bottommargin \fIpixels\fR
Specifies the size of the margin from the x-coordinate axis to the 
bottom of the window.  The x-axis title is displayed in this margin.  
\fIPixels\fR may be specified in any of the forms described in 
\fBTk_GetPixels\fR.  If \fIpixels\fR is less than one pixel, the 
the margin size is selected automatically.
.TP
\fB\-bufferelements \fIboolean\fR
.VS
Specifies whether to use a pixmap to cache the display of elements.

y-axis.  By default \fIboolean\fR is \fCfalse\fR.
.VE
.TP
\fB\-leftmargin \fIpixels\fR
Sets the size of the margin from the left edge of the window to the
the y-coordinate axis.  The y-axis title is displayed in this
margin.  If \fIpixels\fR is less than one pixel, 
the margin size is selected automatically.
.TP
\fB\-plotbackground \fIcolor\fR
Sets the background color of the plotting area.  
.TP
\fB\-plotborderwidth \fIpixels\fR
Sets the width of the 3-D border to draw around the outside of
the plotting area (if such border is being drawn; the \fBplotrelief\fR option
determines this).  By default is the plot border width is \fC2\fR.
.TP
\fB\-plotrelief \fIstring\fR
Specifies the 3-D effect desired for the plotting area.  
\fIString\fR must be in a form accepted by \fBTk_GetRelief\fR. 
It indicates how the interior of the plotting area should appear 
relative to rest of the graph; for example, \fCraised\fR means the 
plot should appear to protrude from the graph, relative to the surface 
of the graph.  By default, the plot relief is \fCsunken\fR.
.TP
\fB\-rightmargin \fIpixels\fR
Sets the size of marging from the plotting area to the right edge 
of the window.  By default, the legend is displayed in this margin.  
If \Ipixels\fR is than 1, the margin size
is selected automatically.
.TP
\fB\-title \fIstring\fR
Specifies the title of the graph.  If \fIstring\fR is the empty string 
(the default), no title is displayed.
.TP
\fB\-topmargin \fIpixels\fR
Sets the size of the marging the top edge of the window to the plotting area.
The graph title is displayed in this margin.  
If \fIpixels\fR is less than 1, the margin size

\fCoption add *Blt_graph.xLogscale true\fR
.DE
.TP
\fB\-color \fIcolor\fR
Sets the color of the axis and its labels.
This option defaults to \fCblack\fR.
.TP
\fB\-command \fIprefix\fR
Specifies a Tcl command to be invoked when formatting the axis labels.
\fIPrefix\fR is typically just the name of a Tcl procedure, but the string
may also contain extra arguments for the procedure.  When invoked, two
arguments (the path name of the graph widget and the numeric value of
the axis label) are appended to the end of the command.  The procedure
value should be a string representing the formatted label. If the value is
the empty string or if \fIprefix\fR is the empty string, the default axis
label is displayed.  Please note that this procedure is invoked during
the display of the graph.  Resetting graph configurations within this 
procedure can cause unexpected results.
.TP
\fB\-descending \fIboolean\fR
.VS
Specifies whether the values along the axis are increasing or decreasing.  
If \fIboolean\fR is true, the axis values will decrease.
By default, the axis values increase.
.VE

Otherwise the axis range fits tightly at the limits of the data displayed. 
By default, the range is tight.
.TP
\fB\-mapped \fIboolean\fR
Specifies if the axis should be displayed. By default, the standard
axes are displayed (x and y), but not the alternate (x2 and y2).
.TP
\fB\-max \fIvalue\fR
Sets the maximum limit of the axis.  Data points exceeding this
limit are clipped at this value. If \fIvalue\fR is the empty string
(the default), the axis is auto-scaled whereby the maximum limit is
determined from the data points of the displayed elements.
.TP
\fB\-min \fIvalue\fR
Sets the minimum limit of the axis. Data points less than this
limit are clipped at this value.  If \fIvalue\fR is the empty string
(the default), the axis is auto-scaled whereby the minimum limit is
determined from the data points of the displayed elements.
.TP
\fB\-rotate \fItheta\fR
Specifies the rotation of the axis labels.  \fITheta\fR is a
real number representing the angle of rotation in degrees.
The default rotation is \fC0.0\fR degrees.

number of minor ticks is \fC5\fR.  If \fInumber\fR is zero, no subticks
will be displayed.
.TP
\fB\-ticklength \fIpixels\fR
.VS
Sets the length of the ticks and subticks (subticks are one-half \fIpixels\fR).
If \fIpixels\fR is negative, ticks will point towards the plot, instead
of away from it.  The tick length is \fC0.1i\fR.

code to set a particular color value (e.g. ``\fC1.0 1.0 0.0 setrgbcolor\fR'').
When outputting color information in PostScript, it checks
to see if there is an element of \fIvarName\fR with the same
name as the color. If so, it uses the value of the element as the 
PostScript command to set the color.
If this option hasn't been specified, or if there isn't an entry
in \fIvarName\fR for a given color, then it uses the red, green,
and blue intensities from the X color.
.TP
\fB\-colormode \fImode\fR
Specifies how to output color information.  \fIMode\fR must be either
\fBcolor\fR (for full color output), \fCgray\fR (convert all colors
to their gray-scale equivalents) or \fCmono\fR (convert foreground colors
to black and background colors to white).  The default mode is \fCcolor\fR.
.TP
\fB\-fontmap \fIvarName\fR
\fIVarName\fR must be the name of a global array variable
that specifies a font mapping from the X font name to PostScript.
Each element of \fIvarName\fR must consist of a Tcl list with
one or two elements, which are the name and point size of a PostScript font.
When outputting PostScript commands for a particular font, Tk
checks to see if \fIvarName\fR contains an element with the same
name as the specified font. 
If there is such an element, then the font information contained in
that element is used in the PostScript output.  (If the point size 
is omitted from the list, the point size of the X font is used).
Otherwise the X font is examined in an attempt to guess what PostScript 
font to use.  This works only for fonts whose foundry property is
\fIAdobe\fR (such as Times, Helvetica, Courier, etc.).  If all of 
this fails then the font defaults to \fCHelvetica-Bold\fR.
.TP
\fB\-landscape \fIboolean\fR
If \fIboolean\fR is \fCtrue\fR, this specifies the printed area is to 
be rotated 90 degrees.
In non-rotated output the \f(BIx\fR axis of the printed area runs along
the short dimension of the page (``portrait'' orientation);
in rotated output the \f(BIx\fR axis runs along the long dimension of the
page (``landscape'' orientation).
Defaults to \fCfalse\fR.
.TP
\fB\-pageanchor \fIanchor\fR
Specifies which point of the printed area should be appear over
the positioning point on the page (which is given by the \fB\-pagex\fR
and \fB\-pagey\fR options).
For example, \fB\-pageanchor n\fR means that the top center of the
printed area should be over the positioning point.
Defaults to \fCnw\fR.
.TP
\fB\-pageheight \fIsize\fR
Specifies that the height of the graph drawn in PostScript.
The graph is \fInot\fR uniformly scaled since this also scales
the fonts.  \fISize\fR may be any value accepted by \fBTk_GetPixels\fR.
The resulting pixel value is then converted to postscript printer
points.  This means that a height \fI8i\fR will be properly
converted to 8 inches. This options defaults to the height of the graph window.
.TP
\fB\-pagewidth \fIsize\fR
Specifies that the width of the graph drawn in PostScript.
The graph is \fInot\fR uniformly scaled since this also scales
the fonts.  \fISize\fR may be any value accepted by \fBTk_GetPixels\fR.
The resulting pixel value is then converted to postscript printer
points.  This means that a width \fI6.5i\fR will be properly
converted to 6.5 inches. This options defaults to the width of the graph window.
.TP
\fB\-pagex \fIposition\fR
Specifies the x-coordinate of the page positioning point.
This (with the \fB-pageanchor\fR option) indicates 
where the graph is placed on the PostScript page.
\fIPosition\fR may be any value accepted by 
\fBTk_GetPixels\fR. The resulting pixel value is then converted to 
postscript printer points.  The default is \fC1i\fR.
.TP
\fB\-pagey \fIposition\fR
Specifies the y-coordinate of the page positioning point.
This (with the \fB-pageanchor\fR option) indicates 
where the graph is placed on the PostScript page.
\fIPosition\fR may be any value accepted by 
\fBTk_GetPixels\fR. The resulting pixel value is then converted to 
postscript printer points.  The default is \fC1i\fR.
.SH "SETTING DATA FROM C"
The data points of any element can be reset from a C routine using
the convenience function \fBBlt_GraphElement\fR.  This can be useful
in situations where it is too expensive to translate the data values
from string representations.  Another possible use could be to read in
special data file formats.
.sp 1
.nf
\fCint Blt_GraphElement(interp, pathName, elemName, numValues, valueArr)
    Tcl_Interp *interp;         /* Interpreter of the graph widget */
    char *pathName;             /* Path name of the graph widget */
    char *elemName;             /* Name of the element to reset */
    int numValues;              /* Number of values in array */
    double *valueArr;           /* Array of x,y coordinate pairs */
\fR
.fi
The interpreter must be the same as the one containing the graph
widget and both the graph and the element specified must 
already exist.
The data array must contain pairs of x,y coordinates.  The number
specified is the total number values in this array.  The data values 
in the array are copied into the graph widget for that element.
You don't need to worry about allocating space for them.
.PP
\fBBlt_GraphElement\fR will return TCL_OK if successful.
The graph will be redrawn with the new data points at the next idle point.
Otherwise it returns TCL_ERROR and "\fCinterp->result\fR"
will contain an error message.  
.SH BINDINGS
There are no default bindings. 
.SH BUGS
Auto-scale routines do not use requested min/max limits
as boundaries when the axis is logarithmically scaled.  
.PP
The needs to be a special mapping for undefined log scale values (>= 0.0). 
Possibly set up a "red zone" of undefined values which divides the 
positive and negative values.
.PP
The PostScript output generated for polygons with more than 1500 points 
may exceed the limits of some printers (See PostScript Language Reference 
Manual, page 568).  The work-around is to break the polygon into
separate pieces.
