Subject: making your X server more secure

Here's how I have made my X sessions more secure than just the xhost
way.  It is mostly transparent, and doesn't allow arbitrary users to
plaster windows on my screen, or to snoop at my keyboard.  Even people
who log into the machine I'm working on can't connect to the server.

This whole scheme is based on the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE scheme, where each
client must present to the server a magic cookie to prove that it is
allowed to connect.  The cookie is kept in a file in your home
directory (.Xauthority) which only you are allowed to read.  The
server reads this file when it starts up, so if you change the cookie
file, you will have to restart the server to make it read the new
information.  Normally you don't need to do this.  The .Xauthority
files can be merged using the xauth program.  See the man page for
some more details.

Here is how to make yourself "secure":

1. Create a .xserverrc file similar to mine in your home directory.
The important part is to pass the "-auth $HOME/.Xauthority" option to
the X server on the last line.  Here is what my .xserverrc file looks
like:

--cut here--
#!/bin/sh
# for Xsun:
# -ar1 NNN	set keyboard repeat delay to NNN milliseconds
# -ar2 NNN	set keyboard repeat rate to NNN milliseconds

if test -w /dev/cgthree0 -o -w /dev/cgsix0; then
  server=Xsun
else
  server=XsunMono
fi

# we *must* do an exec for the server so that signals are handled properly
exec $server -ar1 250 -ar2 20 -auth $HOME/.Xauthority
--cut here--


2. Before you start the X server, be sure to create the .Xauthority
file.  I wrote a shell script to do this, called newcookie.  You must
create a new .Xauthority file when you switch machines, as the name of
the machine the server is on is part of the authority mechanism.  This
is how it knows which cookie to send to which server it is connecting
to.  I run newcookie from my .login file when I am logging into the
console.  If you run newcookie after you start the X server, you are
hosed unless you can remember the random number it generated and
recreate the .Xauthority file by hand; otherwise you will have to quit
and restart the server.

Here is my newcookie program.  If you have a program that generates
md5 signatures, you can use it to generate a strong random number by
passing the -md5 flag.  If you have md4, just edit the script to use
it instead of md5.  If you don't have md4 or md5, then it assumes you
have perl to generate random numbers.  If you don't have perl, then
write your own program to generate a long random number with an even
number of hexadecimal digits in it, and then run "xauth add" like in
my program.  Note that md4 and md5 generate values that an even number
of digits long already.  An implementation of md5 can be found in
Internet RFC 1321.

--cut here--
#!/bin/sh

# create new .Xauthority file

PATH=/usr/local/X/bin:/usr/gnu/bin:$PATH

# try some security
auth=$HOME/.Xauthority
#cp /dev/null $auth

# generate a nice long random key
if [ "$1" = "-md5" ]; then
  # use a random noise source and get a strong checksum of it.
  # this is probably a stronger random number than the other method.
  key=`pstat -pfS | md5`
else
  # quick and dirty.  can probably be recreated if time can be guessed.
  key=`perl -e 'srand; printf int(rand(100000000000000000))'`
  # use $key$key to make sure even length.
  key=$key$key
fi
# add to auth file. 
xauth add ${HOST}/unix:0 . $key
xauth add ${HOST}:0 . $key
--cut here--

3. Make sure any program you run does not do an xhost +<machine>
command.  This will destroy any security you might gain by using
xauth.  Notably, the rcmd script does this.

4. Start the X server using startx.  Things should be secure now.  All
new X clients (from R4 and later) understand this authorization
scheme, so you should never need to run xhost again. (Unless you are
using the standard Ultrix libraries -- but then you get what you
deserve.)  In fact, xhost should report *no* hosts as being allowed
in.
