.TH FLIST 1 MH.6.7 [mh.6]
.SH NAME
flist \- list folders with unseen messages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.in +.5i
.ti -.5i
flist
\%[\-all]
\%[\-unseen]
\%[\-alpha] \%[\-noalpha]
\%[\-recurse] \%[\-norecurse]
\%[\-total] \%[\-nototal]
\%[\-help]

.in -.5i
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program lists those folders that contain messages in the unseen sequence.
This is especially useful if you use some mechanism such as \fIslocal\fP (see MH \fImhook\fP man page) or
\fIprocmail\fP to pre-sort your mail into different folders before
you view it.

\fIFlist\fR will
list all folders, or just those folders with unseen messages
(this is the default),
and for each one the number of messages that are in the unseen sequence
and the total number of messages.
An example of the output is:

.nf
.if t .in +.5i
.ta \w'/rnd/phyl/Mail/EP 'u +\w'ddd 'u +\w'new out of 'u +\w'ddd 'u
+inbox	9	new out of	117
+junklist	3	new out of	72
.re
.if t .in -.5i
.fi

Specifying `\-all'
will produce a line for each folder in the user's MH directory,
or list all folders under the user's MH directory
recursively (with `\-recurse').

A `\-nototal' switch will produce only the number of unseen messages,
and suppress the total number of messages in the folder.

The sorting order for the listing is alphabetical (with '\-alpha'),
or in a priority order defined by the Folder-Order profile entry (with '\-noalpha').  Each item in the Folder-Order is a folder name or a folder name pattern
that uses * to match zero or more characters.  Longer matching patterns have
precedence over shorter matching patterns.  For example:

.nf
Folder-Order: personal petproject mh* * admin *junk
.fi

This order puts a few interesting folders first, such as those with mail
addressed to you personally, those about a pet project, and those
about mh-related things.  It shoves uninteresting folders to the end,
and it puts everything else in the middle in alphabetical order.
