.SH INTRODUCTION
The Mail User's Shell (Mush) is an interface for sending and manipulating
a database of electronic mail messages under the
.IR UNIX (TM)
environment.
There are three user interfaces that allow the user to interact with
.I Mush.
The default interface is the conventional tty-based line mode
similar to command line interpreters such as
.I csh
as well as other mailers, such as University of California, Berkeley's
.I Mail
and Bell Lab's System V
.I mailx
interface.
This mode requires nothing from the terminal in terms of screen
capability and may be run on many different versions of the
.IR UNIX (TM)
operating system.
.PP
The text-graphics
.RI ( curses )
interface is reminiscent of the
.I vi
visual editor, but is user-configurable to simulate other editors.
This interface does not require graphics capabilities of
the computer or the terminal on which it is run, but the terminal must
have the minimum capabilities required by any visual screen editor.
.PP
The
.I window
interface for the Sun Workstation utilizes the icon and
menu based (mouse selectable) windowing system.
This
.I tool
(graphics) mode is highly subject to the version of operating system
your Sun may be running.
It is intended to be run on Sun versions 3.5 and higher (those that have the
SunView window system).
.PP
See the corresponding sections for more information on the user
interface desired.
Most of this manual deals with commands, variables
and actions that are common to all three interfaces although
some attention is paid to individual characteristics of each interface.
.PP
The following command line arguments are understood by
.I Mush
(full word forms in parentheses):
.TP
\-b bcc-list
(\-blindcarbon, \-blind)
The list of Blind Carbon Copy recipients is set on the command line.
If more than one address or an address containing spaces is specified, the
entire list should be enclosed in quotes.
This option applies when sending mail only.
If you are entering the shell, curses mode, or the tool mode, this option is
ignored.
.TP
\-C
(\-curses)
Enter the mailer in curses mode upon startup.
.TP
\-c cc-list
(\-carbon, \-copy)
The list of Carbon Copy recipients is set on the command line.
If more than one address or an address containing spaces is specified, the
entire list should be enclosed in quotes.
This option applies when sending mail only.
If you are entering the shell, curses mode, or the tool mode, this option is
ignored.
.TP
\-d
(\-debug)
Turns on the debugging level to 1.
You can change debugging levels from within the shell using the
.B debug
command.
.TP
\-e
(\-echo)
Normally, the program runs with the local echo off and each character
typed is processed individually so as to process certain macros and
keyboard mappings.
This option suppresses this from taking place
and the program only processes input after a carriage return has
been hit.
Under normal circumstances, this action is transparent to
the user and the use of this option is discouraged except when using
a debugger with the program.
Note that if this option is specified,
any key sequences set by map or map! do not substitute their expansions.
This option is ignored for curses mode.
.TP
\-F[!] filename
(\-source)
This file is the same type as the initialization file read on startup
(see INITIALIZATION) with the exception that commands that manipulate
or search messages may be given.
Normally, such commands may not appear in the initialization file since
that file is read before the folder is scanned.
The file specified by \-F is read after the folder is scanned, so
commands that affect messages are allowed.
The optional `!' prevents the shell from running after the
file has been sourced.
Otherwise,
.I Mush
continues into whatever interface has been specified.
.TP
\-f [ filename ]
(\-folder)
The optional filename argument specifies a folder containing mail messages.
With no argument,
.B mbox
in the current directory (or the variable
.BR mbox )
is used.
If no filename is given, this option must be last on the command line.
.TP
\-H[:c]
(\-headers)
Have
.I Mush
display mail headers without entering the shell.
See the
.B headers
command for information on the
.B :c
argument.
No colon modifier is equivalent to \*Q\-H:a\*U.
This option prevents the shell from running, so this option turns off the
\-S and \-C flags.
This option is ignored if the tool mode is in effect.
.TP
\-h draft-file
(-draft)
This option specifies a previously prepared message file (called a draft)
which is read in as a new message to be sent.
The current implementation requires that the draft file must contain all the
message headers;
.I Mush
adds only a new \*QDate:\*U and a \*QFrom:\*U header if there is none.
If there is no \*QTo:\*U header, the draft is not sent.
See the
.B mail
command and the section on \*QSending mail\*U for more information.
.TP
\-I[!] filename
(\-init)
This option specifies an initialization file to be read
.I before
any of the other
.I Mush
initialization is done.
The file specified by \-I is read before the default system initialization
file is read (see the INITIALIZATION section for details).
The optional `!' argument prevents
.I Mush
from reading the default system file, so \-I! can be used to specify a
substitute default file.
The user's personal initialization file is read normally.
.TP
\-i
(\-interact)
Forces interactive mode even if input has been redirected to the program.
This is intended for remote host mail sessions (with -e) but also allows
the user to redirect input from a \*Qscript\*U of
.I Mush
commands.
See the INITIALIZATION and MUSH SCRIPTS sections for information on how to
write scripts that deal with mail.
Note that this flag is different from the \*Qignore\*U flag of UCB Mail.
.TP
\-m mailbox-path
(\-mailbox)
The mailbox specified is interpreted as if it is the user's main
(system) mailbox in place of /usr/spool/mail/$USER (or whatever path is
applicable for your system and Mail Transport Agent).
.TP
\-N
(\-noheaders)
Enter
.I Mush
without displaying any message headers.
This argument is passed to the
.B folder
command.
.TP
\-n[!]
(\-noinit)
No initialization is done on start up.
That is, do not source the default system initialization files.
If the `!' argument is given, reading of the user's personal
.I .mushrc
or
.I .mailrc
files is also suppressed.
See the INITIALIZATION section for more information on
startup and the significance of these files.
.TP
\-r
(\-readonly)
Initialize the folder in Read-Only mode; no modification of the folder is
permitted.
This argument is passed on to the
.B folder
command.
.TP
\-S
(\-shell)
This flag allows the user to enter the shell even if the system
mailbox or specified folder is empty or doesn't exist.
.TP
\-s subject
(\-subject)
The subject is set on the command line using this flag.
If the subject has
any spaces or tabs, the entire subject should be enclosed in quotes.
This applies when sending mail only.
If you are entering the shell,
curses mode, or the tool mode, this option is ignored.
.TP
\-T timeout
(\-timeout)
In the tool mode (Sun only),
.I timeout
specifies the length of time (seconds) to wait between each check for new mail.
30 seconds is the smallest time allowed for performance reasons;
60 seconds is the default value.
This option should be used either in place of \-t or immediately after it.
.TP
\-t
(\-tool)
Use the graphics tool mode (Sun only).
This option must be the first one on the command line, before any Sun window
system flags or other \fIMush\fR options.
.sp
.I
NOTE:  The \-t option is obsolete and may be eliminated in future revisions.
The preferred way to run the tool mode of \fIMush\fR is to use the command
.BR mushtool ,
which is a link to
.BR mush .
.TP
\-u [ user ]
(\-user)
The mailbox to use is /usr/spool/mail/\fBuser\fR.
If the login name for user is not specified, then root is used.
.TP
\-U[!]
(-send)
This option may be used only with \-h (\-draft).
It causes the draft file to be sent immediately without further editing
(\*Qunedited\*U, hence \-U).
If the optional `!' is appended, signatures and fortunes are suppressed.
See the
.B mail
command and the section on \*QSending mail\*U for more information.
.TP
\-v
(\-verbose)
Verbose mode is turned on.
This option is passed to the actual mail delivery
subsystem internal to your version of
.IR UNIX (TM).
Some mailers do not have a verbose option, so this flag may not apply
to your system (System V, for example).
This applies when sending mail only.
If you are entering the shell,
curses mode, or the tool mode, this option is ignored.
.SH "GENERAL USAGE"
Because there are three different interfaces available to the user,
the tty characteristics (backspace, kill-word, kill-line, redraw line)
are simulated identically in all interfaces.
When the user has to type something, the 4.2BSD style of tty driver interface
is simulated whether you're in the window system, the curses mode, or
the tty-line mode, and even on System-V machines.
This means that backspacing causes a
backspace-space-backspace effect (erasing the character backspaced over).
The user may reset his tty characteristics using the
.B stty
command.
.PP
.IR "New mail" .
.PP
If during a
.I Mush
session, new mail arrives for you, it is automatically incorporated into
your system mailbox and you are told that new mail has arrived.
.PP
In the default line mode, new mail is checked after each command
issued.
In the curses mode, new mail is checked on each
command and is displayed in the bottom line of the screen.
In the tool based graphics mode, new mail is checked approximately
every minute or the number of seconds specified by the
.B -T
option on the command line.
.PP
If you are using your system mailbox as your \*Qcurrent folder,\*U then the
new mail is added immediately to your current
list of messages and information similar to the following example is
displayed, to tell you whom the mail is from:
.sp
.ti +2
New mail (#15) argv@zipcode.com (Dan Heller)
.sp
If you are not in your system mailbox, then the new mail is not added
to your list of messages, but you are instead informed of the new arrival.
.sp
If you are using the tool based mode and
.I Mush
is closed to an iconic state, then the number of messages in the current
folder is displayed on the mailbox icon and the flag on the mailbox goes up.
.PP
.IR "Displaying messages" .
.PP
Depending on the interface you use, you can display any message in your
list of messages as long as the message is not marked for deletion.
If the message is marked as deleted, then use the 
.B undelete
command supplied by the interface you are using.
To display a message in line mode, specify the message using
.BR print ,
.BR type ,
.BR p ,
.BR t ,
or type a message number to display that message on the screen.
.PP
In curses mode, move the cursor over the message you want and type
a `t' or `p' to read the message.
You may \*Qbind\*U other keys to call
the function that displays messages if `t' and `p' are uncomfortable.
.PP
In the tool mode, move the cursor over the header summary of the
message you wish to be displayed and select the LEFT mouse button.
The MIDDLE mouse button deletes the message, and the RIGHT button
brings up a menu of additional options, including help.
If the message you want is not visible (in the header subwindow), you may type
the number of the message in the \*QRange:\*U item, and press return.
That message number is displayed.
Finally, the \*QNext\*U item in the panel below the header display
can be used to step through the folder, one message at a time.
.PP
In the line or curses mode, if the message has more lines than the variable
.BR crt ,
then a
.I pager
is invoked to allow the user to page through the message without
having it scroll off the screen.
The pager used is determined by the variable
.BR pager .
If that variable is unset, then a default pager is used.
Note that if pager is set, but not to a value, or is set to the value
of \*Qinternal\*U, then the internal pager is used.
The internal pager
is very simple; the spacebar displays the next
.B crt
lines, carriage return prints the next line, and \*Qq\*U quits the pager.
.PP
In the tool mode, if a message is larger than the size of the message
subwindow, the scrollbar at the left side of the window may be used to
page the message forwards and backwards.
The variable
.B crt_win
may be set in an initialization file to preset the size of the
message display subwindow.
.PP
An alternative to displaying messages is the
.B top
command.
This command prints just the top few lines of a message.
The number of lines is determined by the variable
.BR toplines .
If this variable isn't set,
.B top
prints a number of lines equal to the value of the variable
.BR crt .
.PP
.IR "Sorting mail" .
.PP
.I Mush
allows you to sort your mail according to various constraints such
as time, size, status (new, unread, deleted, etc.), author and subject.
See the
.B sort
command in the COMMANDS section for more information on sorting.
Sorting has a panel item in the tool mode, and is bound by default
to the `o' (sort) and `O' (sort reverse) keys in curses mode.
.PP
.IR "Picking specific messages" .
.PP
You can select messages that contain unique information, or from
messages that have special attributes.
You have the option of restricting your search to messages between dates,
message numbers, author names and other constraints.
See the
.B pick
command in the COMMANDS section for complete details.
This feature is not directly accessible from the tool mode, and is
available only as a search action in curses mode (see, however, the
CURSES INTERFACE section for temporary escapes to line mode).
.PP
.IR "Sending mail" .
.PP
You can send mail by listing addresses on the command line when
.I Mush
is started, by using the
.B mail
command from within
.IR Mush ,
or by responding to other mail.
In curses mode, the `m' key invokes mail, and the `r' key begins a response.
In the tool mode, selecting the \*QCompose\*U or \*QReply\*U items on the main
panel opens a separate frame for message composition.
The message replied-to is either the current message or one specified in
the \*QRange:\*U item.
.PP
When you are sending mail, you are in a mode where everything
you type is added to the contents of the message.
When you are done typing your message in line or curses modes,
you can type `^D' (control-D) to signify the end of the message.
If you have the variable
.B dot
set, then you can end a message with a `.' on a line by itself.
In the tool mode, select the \*QSend\*U item in the composition frame
to finish and send the message.
.PP
While you are composing a message,
.I Mush
treats lines beginning with the character `~' specially.
This is called a
.BR "tilde escape" .
For instance, typing \*Q~i\*U (alone on a line) places a copy
of the \*Qcurrent message\*U into your message body.
It does not include the message headers of the message, just the body of
text that comprises the message.
A subset of these escapes are available in the tool mode, and others are
provided as panel items or as menu selections from the \*QInclude\*U item.
Tilde escapes which alter message headers are not usable when the variable
.B edit_hdrs
is set or when the \-E option was passed to the
.B mail
command.
.PP
The tool mode composition window uses header editing at all times, but
provides some of these escapes anyway; see the descriptions below, and the
description of the
.B edit_hdrs
variable, for complete details.
.PP
Available
.BR "tilde escapes" :
[OPTIONAL arguments in square brackets]
.TP
~a file
Append message buffer to file name.
Accessed via the \*QExport\*U panel item in tool mode.
.TP
~b [bcc-list]
Modify blind carbon recipients; otherwise identical to ~t.
In tool mode, moves the cursor to the Bcc: header, adding one if necessary.
.TP
~c [cc-list]
Modify carbon copy recipients; otherwise identical to ~t.
In tool mode, moves the cursor to the Cc: header, adding one if necessary.
.TP
~E[!]
Erase message buffer; not available in tool mode.
Saves the contents of the letter to \*Qdead.letter\*U
(unless the `!' is specified) and then clears the message buffer; the user
remains in editing mode.
If the variable
.B nosave
is set, then `!' need not be specified.
.TP
~e [editor]
Enter the editor.
Defaults to variable
.BR editor ,
environment EDITOR, or
.IR vi ,
except in tool mode, where ~e is equivalent to ~v.
.TP
~F[!]
Add a fortune [don't add] at end of message.
Accessed via the \*QFortune\*U panel item in tool mode.
.TP
~f [msg-list]
Forward mail.
The included messages are not indented,
but are marked as \*Qforwarded mail\*U.
Accessed via the \*QInclude\*U panel item in tool mode.
.TP
~h
Modify all message headers.
Each header is displayed one by one and each may be edited.
In tool mode, moves to the To: header; typing a carriage return 
advances the input cursor to each of the other headers in turn.
The mouse cursor changes to a \*Qbent arrow\*U when automatic
input cursor advance is active.
.TP
~I [msg-list]
Same as ~i, but also include the message headers.
Accessed via the \*QInclude\*U panel item in tool mode.
.TP
~i [msg-list]
Include the body of the current message (or listed messages).
Accessed via the \*QInclude\*U panel item in tool mode.
See the descriptions of the variables
.BR indent_str ,
.BR pre_indent_str ,
and
.BR post_indent_str .
.TP
~p [pager]
Page the message body; not available in tool mode.
Defaults to variable
.BR pager ,
environment PAGER, or the default pager set up by the system administrator.
This may be the internal pager.
To completely disable paging, set pager to \*QNONE\*U.
.TP
~q
Quit message; save in ~/dead.letter if
.B nosave
is not set.
Not available in tool mode.
.TP
~r file
Read filename into message buffer.
Accessed via the \*QImport\*U panel item in tool mode.
.TP
~S[!]
Include [don't include] signature at end of message.
The variables
.B autosign
and
.B autosign2
describe the file or string to append to the message.
See the VARIABLES section for more information on these variables.
Accessed via the \*QAutosign\*U panel item in tool mode.
.TP
~s [subject]
Modify the subject header.
In tool mode, moves to the Subject: header, adding one if necessary.
In other modes,
if an argument is given (a new subject), then the subject line is
.I replaced
by the new subject line.
If none is given, then the subject line is
displayed for editing just as in the ~t command.
.TP
~t [list]
Change list of recipients (\*QTo\*U list).
In tool mode, moves the cursor to the To: header.
In other modes,
if a list is given, this list is
.B appended
to the current list.
If no list is given, then the current list
is displayed and the cursor placed at the end of the list.
You can backspace over the stuff in the list or you can append more
addresses onto the end of the list as desired.
.TP
~u
Up one line; not available in tool mode.
If the user made a mistake typing a letter and he
has already hit carriage return, he may avoid entering the editor
and edit the previous line using ~u.
The line is retyped and
the cursor is placed at the end allowing the user to backspace
over it and retype the line.
System-V users should note that if
the new line is shorter than it was before the ~u command, the
line is padded with blanks to the previous length of the file.
.TP
~v [editor]
Enter the visual editor; works in tool mode.
Also accessible through the \*QEdit\*U button in tool mode.
Defaults to variable
.BR visual ,
environment VISUAL, or
.IR vi .
.TP
~w file
Write message buffer to the indicated file.
Accessible in tool mode via the \*QExport\*U panel item.
When the header editing is in use (the variable
.B edit_hdrs
or the \-E option of
.BR mail ),
this tilde-command can be used to create a \fIdraft file\fR.
Draft files are partially completed letters that you wish to save for
editing and eventually sending later.
See the
.B mail
command for a description of rereading and sending drafts.
.TP
~x
Exit message; don't save in dead.letter.
Accessible in tool mode via the \*QAbort\*U panel item.
.TP
~$variable
Insert the string value for variable into message; not available in tool mode.
If a boolean variable is listed, nothing is appended regardless of its value.
.TP
~:command
Run the
.I Mush
command specified by \*Qcommand\*U; not available in tool mode.
You may not run any command that sends mail.
It is inadvisable to change folders at this time
since the current message list may be corrupted, but the action is
allowed nonetheless to provide flexibility for experienced users.
.TP
~~
A line beginning with two escape characters is unaffected by
.I Mush
except that only a single tilde is inserted into the letter.
.PP
The variable
.B escape
may be set to describe a character other than `~' to be used as the
escape character.
However,
.I "tilde escapes are normally NOT interpreted when"
Mush
.IR "is started with redirected input" .
If tilde-interpretation is desired, use the \-i option when starting
.IR mush .
.PP
.IR "Mail Aliases" .
.PP
Mail aliases are shorthand names for long mail addresses.
These are supported in the same manner as UCB Mail supports them.
Because
.I Mush
has command line history reminiscent of
.IR csh ,
commands that use UUCP's `!' character for user-host and host-host
separation should be escaped (preceded by a backslash).
This is not necessary in the initialization file (.mushrc) because history
referencing is ignored while these files are being sourced.
See the INITIALIZATION and LINE-MODE INTERFACE sections for more
information on initialization file format and the history mechanism.
.PP
Aliases reference normal mailing addresses as well as other aliases.
If a loop is detected, then the user is notified and the message is forced
into the file
.B dead.letter
in the user's home directory.
The
.B unalias
command is used to reverse the effects of the
.B alias
command.
From the tool mode, aliases can be set and unset in an
.IR "aliases subwindow" .
Press the RIGHT mouse button on the \*QOptions\*U item in the main
frame, and select \*QAliases\*U from the menu.
.PP
.IR Help .
.PP
.I Mush
was designed so that each command or action should not be a mystery.
Helping the user understand what to do and how to do whatever he wishes
is the goal behind the help facility.
For this reason, the
.B help
command gives information on both general usage and a few specific help
categories.
.PP
In text mode, most help is obtained by typing \-? as an argument to a
command.
Almost every command has the \-? option.
When this option is specified, most commands attempt to read from
a help file a brief explanation of the functionality of the command.
If necessary, a pointer to other sources of information is
given to fully explain a concept.
.PP
In line mode, typing `?' as a command displays a list of possible commands.
In the curses mode, the `?' key displays help message, which explains
how to obtain a list of the current key-to-command bindings; a keystroke
or set of keystrokes correspond directly to a command.
.PP
In the tool mode, this is
also available, but more extensive help is provided in the pop-up menus.
Press the RIGHT mouse button (the \*Qmenu button\*U) when pointing to any
panel button and a number of items appear in a menu.
The last command in the menu list is often one labeled \*Qhelp\*U.
If a button does not have a menu or has no help item, check the
menu of the \*QHelp\*U button for related topics.
Selecting any help item opens a new scrollable window with help text.
.I "Note:  The limited number of file descriptors in SunOS 3.5 forces"
Mush
.I "to display help information in the"
.IR "message window in the main frame" .
.\" Some nroffs can't handle long .IR arguments
.SH INITIALIZATION
After the command line arguments have been interpreted
.I Mush
reads commands from one or more
.B "initialization files"
that (typically) set variable values, aliases, command line aliases,
and so forth.
Any file specified by the \-I option is read first.
Next, if neither \-I! nor \-n was given, a default system initialization
file is read.
The system default file
is set up by the system administrator and may contain commands that
should be set system-wide.
Finally, if \-n! was not given,
.I Mush
reads the user's personal initialization file.
.PP
The user's file is determined by first looking for the environment variables
.I MUSHRC
or
.IR MAILRC .
If neither of those environment variables is set, then the file
.I .mushrc
is searched for in the home directory of the user.
If that file cannot be found,
.I Mush
attempts to read the file
.I .mailrc
from the same directory.
Finally, if that file cannot be read, no initialization is done
and the default values are in effect.
.PP
If the user has no home directory, or permissions prevent read/write access
to $HOME, /tmp is used as the home directory.
See the
.B home
variable under the VARIABLES section.
.PP
Once in the shell, the
.B source
command may be used to specify a file if you want to read commands
from a file other than the default.
The command
.B saveopts
saves all variable settings, aliases, and all other
.I Mush
settable attributes, to aid in creating an initialization file.
If no filename is given on the command line,
the
.B source
and
.B saveopts
commands choose a file in the manner described above.
.B Saveopts
does not overwrite the file if it exists.
In such cases, you are prompted to confirm overwrite.
If you confirm overwriting the existing file, remember that existing \*Qif\*U
expressions or other manually entered comments or non variable-setting type
commands that previously existed in the file are lost.
.PP
No interactive commands should be called from any initialization file.
These commands are not prevented because it is impossible to trace which
commands are actually
.IR UNIX (TM)
commands that are interactive.
The responsibility of not running interactive commands is left to the user.
Because the initialization file is read
.I before
any messages are read into the program,
message filtering commands should not be placed in this file unless you know
you're going to
.IB re- source
the file later as a command.
.PP
.IR "Initialization File Format" .
When reading the initialization file,
.I Mush
recognizes the `#' character as a comment character.
It may be anywhere on a line in the file.
When that character is encountered,
processing of that line is discontinued to the end of the line.
If the `#' is enclosed in quotes (single or double), then it is not
considered a comment.
Examples:
.sp
.ti +2
set shell = /bin/csh  # set the shell variable

.PP
The
.B exit
command has special meaning in the initialization file.
If the command is found,
.I Mush
does not exit, but rather, discontinues reading from the file immediately.
.PP
There may be \*Qif\*U expressions within the initialization file to determine
certain runtime states of
.IR Mush .
No parentheses are allowed and only one boolean expression may be
evaluated per line; that is, no \*Q&&\*U or \*Q|\||\*U may be used in
expressions.
An \*Qelse\*U on a line by itself may precede alternative
actions.
\&\*QIf\*U expressions may be nested to any reasonable depth, but
there must always be an \*Qendif\*U matching each \*Qif\*U expression.
The statements associated with an \*Qif\*U expression are never on the
same line with the conditional expression.
.PP
Conditional expressions understood include the internal variables
.IR istool ,
.IR iscurses ,
.IR is_shell ,
.IR hdrs_only ,
.IR is_sending ,
and
.IR redirect .
These are internal variables whose values cannot be referenced using the
\*Q$variable\*U method of variable expansion.
If
.I istool
is true, the program is going to run in the tool mode.
If
.I iscurses
is true, the program is in or is going to run in the curses mode even
though the screen package may not yet have been started.
If
.I is_shell
is true, then
.I Mush
has entered the shell;
.I is_shell
is always false at startup when initialization files are read,
and is always true when files are sourced after initialization with the
.B source
command or the \-F option.
.PP
If
.I hdrs_only
is true, then the -H flag on the command line has been given.
If
.I is_sending
is true, then the user is sending mail to another user.
This does not imply
that the user is not going to be running a shell after the mail is sent.
If
.I redirect
is true, then input to the program is redirected.
The test for redirection tells whether input, not output, has been
redirected to the program.
The
.B \-i
option on the command line is required to run the shell if redirect is on.
If \-i is specified, the value for
.I redirect
is set to false.
Note that any time
.I Mush
runs when not connected to a terminal, it
believes that input has been redirected.
See the MUSH SCRIPTS section for more details.
.PP
The `!' operator may be used to negate expressions, thus,
.sp
.nf
.in +2
if !istool
.ti +4
exit
else
.ti +4
set autoprint
endif
.in -2
.fi
.sp
means that if you are not running as a tool, stop reading commands from this
file.
Otherwise, set the autoprint variable.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
set hdr_format = "%25f %7d (%l/%c) %25s"
if hdrs_only
.ti +4
exit
endif
.in -2
.fi
.sp
This tells the program to set the hdr_format variable and check to see if
we're running the program to read headers only.
If so, stop reading this file (exit) and continue on with the program.
This speeds up runtime quite a bit for those who have lengthy initialization
files, because no other shell variables are necessary.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
if !iscurses
.ti +4
set crt = 24 screen = 18
endif
.in -2
.fi
.sp
This segment checks to see that we're not running in curses mode, and if not
it sets our crt and screen sizes.
This is mostly because the curses mode sets those values for us by looking
at the size of the screen.
See the CURSES INTERFACE section for configuring your
environment so you enter curses mode each time you run the shell.
.PP
String evaluation is allowed in \*Qif\*U expressions, and the operators
\*Q==\*U and \*Q!=\*U may be used to determine equality or inequality,
and \*Q=~\*U and \*Q!~\*U may be used for pattern-matching.
Usually, variables are compared with constants for evaluation.
.PP
Note that it is not possible to compare variables to an empty string, and
variables that evaluate to an empty string may cause errors.
It is possible to test whether a variable is set by using the syntax
\*Q$?variable\*U (as in
.IR csh )
but there is not currently any way to test for an empty string value.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
if $TERM == adm3a
.ti +4
set pager = more
else
.ti +4
set pager = less
endif
.in -2
.fi
.sp
This segment tests to see if the user's terminal type is \*Qadm3a\*U.
If it is, then it sets the pager variable to be the 
.I more
program.
Note that the variable TERM is obtained from the user's environment if a
shell variable is not set already.
Otherwise, the pager variable is set to \*Qless\*U.
This exemplifies the fact that
.I less
frequently fails to function correctly
for the terminal type \*Qadm3a\*U so we don't use it.
.sp
Also supported in \*Qif\*U expressions are the test flags \*Q-e\*U
and \*Q-z\*U.  These flags test to see if a file exists (\*Q-e\*U) or
if it is zero-length (\*Q-z\*U).
These are most useful in command files that are to be read after the
shell has started; see the examples in the MUSH SCRIPTS section.
.PP
After sourcing the initialization file,
.I Mush
reads all the mail out of the specified folder (the system spool directory
if no folder is given) and creates a list of messages.
The current maximum number of messages the user
can load is set to 1000 by default.
The system administrator who configures the program can reset this
value higher or lower if you ask nicely.
If the user has the
.B sort
variable set, then when the current folder's messages have all been read,
the messages are sorted according to the value of the
variable (see the
.B sort
entry under the VARIABLES heading for more information).
Each message has a number of message header lines that contain information
about whom the mail is from, the subject of the message, the date it was
received, and other information about the letter.
This information is then compiled into a one-line summary for
each message and is printed out in an appropriate manner
depending on the interface you're using.
.PP
At this point, commands may be input by the user.
Lengthy or complex commands can be placed in a file and then executed via the
.B source
command.
Such files use the same format as the initialization files and may use all
the same tests in \*Qif\*U expressions.
Sourcing of a file of filter commands such as those in the example above
can be automated by using the \-F option when \fIMush\fR is started.
Also see the MUSH SCRIPTS section for other uses.
.SH "LINE-MODE INTERFACE"
In the line-mode, the user is given a prompt to which commands are issued
and arguments are passed to commands.
When the user types at the prompt, each line is parsed and words (or
arguments) are separated into an array of strings.
This array, also called an
.IR "argument vector" ,
is then modified by expanding history references, command line aliases,
and variable references.
A command line ends when the end of the line is encountered or a pipe (|)
or semicolon (;) character is encountered, separating discrete commands.
.PP
When a command line has been parsed and placed in an argument vector, the
first argument in the vector (the \*Qcommand\*U) is searched for in a list
of legal
.I Mush
commands.
If found, the function associated with that command is called and
the rest of the line is passed to that function as
.IR "command line arguments" .
.PP
Before commands are called, however, the input the user gives is preprocessed
in a style reminiscent of the C-shell
.RI ( csh ).
.I Mush
also supports a subset from each of the following aspects of
.IR csh :
.in +2
\(bu Command history.
.br
\(bu Command line aliasing.
.br
\(bu \*QPiping\*U mechanism to
redirect \*Qinput\*U and \*Qoutput\*U of commands.
.br
\(bu Filename metacharacters.
.in -2
.PP
.BR "Command history" .
.PP
.I Mush
supports a history mechanism similar to that supplied by
.IR csh .
A subset of
.I csh
history modifiers are supported to reference previously
issued commands and to extract specified arguments from these commands.
.PP
The history mechanism remembers a list of past commands whose length is
bounded by the value of the
.B history
variable.
If this variable is not set, only the most recent command is remembered.
To reference previously typed commands, the `!' character
is used in the same manner as in
.IR csh .
There is a limited implementation of history modification;
supported are the argument selectors that reference
command line arguments and \*Q:p\*U (echo, but don't execute the command).
.sp
Examples:
.nf
.in +2
.ta 1i
!-2:$	two commands ago, last argument.
!3:2-4	the third command, arguments two through four.
!!:p	print the last command in its entirety.
.in -2
.fi
.PP
During the sourcing of initialization files (.mushrc), history is not
in effect and therefore the `!' character does not cause history expansion.
This includes startup of the program and when the command
.I source
is issued.
UUCP style addresses that contain the `!' character may be given in the
initialization file without the need to be preceded by a backslash.
However, `!' does need to be escaped if
.BR cmd 's
are used to reference command line arguments.
.PP
.BR "Command line aliasing" .
.PP
Command aliases are different from mail aliases in that they are used
to expand to commands.
This feature enables command substitution similar to
.IR csh .
To be backwards compatible with UCB Mail, the
.B alias
command is used for address aliasing.
Thus, the command
.B cmd
is introduced in place of
.BR alias .
.PP
Examples:
.nf
.in +2
cmd d delete
cmd t type
cmd dt 'd ; t'
cmd - previous
cmd r 'reply \\!* -e -i'
.in -2
.fi
.sp
In the last example, if the user types \*Qr 5\*U,
.I Mush
replies to sender of the fifth message and pass all the other
arguments along to the
.B reply
command.
Note the escaping of the `!' character.
This must also be done if set in the initialization file (.mushrc).
Had the user not specified a message number on the `r' command line,
.B reply
would respond to the \*Qcurrent message\*U rather than the fifth message.
.PP
.BR "Piping commands" .
.PP
.I Mush
commands can be \*Qpiped\*U to one another so as to provide output of
one command to be used as input to the next command in the pipeline.
However, the output of commands is not the \*Qtext\*U that is returned
(as it is in
.I sh
and
.IR csh ),
but instead is a
.B "message list"
of the messages that were affected.  A
.B "message list"
is defined as the set of messages that the user specifies in a command or
the messages a command affects after it is through executing.
When one command is piped to another, the effect is that the second command
considers only those messages affected by the first command.
In most cases,
.I Mush
is smart enough to know when piping is occurring and may suppress text output
that a command might produce.
.PP
Examples:
.sp
.ti +2
pick -f fred | save fred_mail
.sp
This finds all the messages from \*Qfred\*U
and saves them all in the file named fred_mail.
.sp
.ti +2
lpr 4-8 | delete
.sp
This sends messages 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 to the printer and then deletes them.
.sp
.ti +2
headers :o | delete
.sp
Deletes all old (already read) mail.
.PP
Because action is taken on mail messages, not files,
metacharacters such as `*' and `?' are not expanded to file names as
.I csh
does.
Instead,
.I Mush
commands take
.I "message lists"
as arguments (a list references one or messages) to take action upon.
When referencing message numbers,
.I Mush
understands the following special syntax:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
.ta 1.0i
*	All messages
^	The first message
$	The last message
\&.	The current message
N\-M	A range of messages between N and M, inclusive
.sp
.fi
.in -2
In the last case, N and M may be * ^ $ . or digits referencing
explicit message numbers.
The range must be in ascending order.
.sp
You can also negate messages by placing the message list inside
braces, `{' `}' \*- thus, the expression \*Q2-19 {11-14}\*U references
messages 2 through 19 except for messages 11 through 14.
.sp
Note that message lists are parsed left to right.
Negated messages may be reset by turning them on
again later in the argument list.
A common error new users make is to specify a negated list without
specifying any beginning messages.
.sp
.ti +2
delete { 6 }
.sp
In this example, the user attempted to delete all messages
except for number 6.
He should have specified `*' beforehand.
A correct example:
.sp
.ti +2
preserve ^-. { 3 }
.sp
Here, the user specifies a valid message list and causes
.I Mush
to preserve all messages from the beginning of the list (message 1)
to the current message, excluding message 3.
.PP
As discussed, after the command line is parsed, the command given is
called and the rest of the arguments on the command line are passed to it.
If no
.I Mush
command has been found that matches the one given, then the variable
.B unix
is checked.
If it is set,
.I Mush
attempts to run the command line as a
.IR UNIX (TM)
command.
.PP
If
.B unix
is not set, or if the command could not be found in the user's PATH
environment, a message is printed indicating that the command was
not found.
.PP
Since no \*Qmessages\*U are affected by \fIUNIX\fR
commands, those that appear within \fIMush\fR
pipelines are executed by the \fBpipe\fR command.
A \fIUNIX\fR command may never be the first command in a pipeline
unless the \fBpipe\fR command is used explicitly.
If the user wishes to execute \fIUNIX\fR
commands that are to be piped to one another (or use any sort of redirection),
the command \fBsh\fR is provided for such purposes.
Since \fIMush\fR parses the entire command line, caution should be
taken to enclose questionable shell variables or metacharacters with
quotes to prevent \fIMush\fR from expanding them.
See the COMMANDS heading below for more detail.
.PP
This shell-like quality is for the convenience of the user and is not
intended to replace the functionality of
.IR sh ,
.IR csh ,
or any other command interpreter.
.PP
.BR "Filename metacharacters" .
.PP
.IR Mush "'s"
command interpreter does not normally pre-expand metacharacters in the
manner of other shells, because the metacharacters may refer to either
messages or files.
Instead, those commands that deal with file names do any necessary
metacharacter expansion.
Two metacharacters are nearly always recognized:  `~' refers to the user's
home directory, and `+' refers to the user's folder directory (\*Q~/Mail\*U
or the value of the variable
.BR folder ).
Another user's home directory can also be referenced as \*Q~username\*U,
and for this reason files in the user's home directory must be referenced
as \*Q~/filename\*U.
However, the `/' character is optional when referring to folders;
that is, \*Q+filename\*U and \*Q+/filename\*U both refer
to the same file in the folder directory.
.PP
If filename completion is enabled by setting the variable
.BR complete ,
the command interpreter expands
.IR csh -style
metacharacters when completing filenames.
A completion containing metacharacters expands to all the files matching
the pattern when the completion key is pressed (defaults to ESC, `^[').
See the description of
.B complete
for limitations of this facility.
.SH "CURSES INTERFACE"
The curses interface utilizes the curses routines intrinsic to most
.I UNIX
systems.
This interface is screen oriented rather
than line oriented and allows the user to access commands and messages
more quickly at the cost of history, piping, and a few commands.
.PP
Many users who prefer the curses interface might want to always start
all their mail sessions in the curses interface.
Putting the
.B curses
command in your initialization file is allowed, but you can also create
an alias or function in your login shell to always use the -C option.
.I Mush
attempts to know not to run a shell if you're just sending mail to
someone, so the
.I csh
command sequences:
.sp
.ti +2
% alias mail 'mush -C'
.ti +2
% mail fred
.sp
sends mail to fred but does not enter the shell.
However, if you just said \*Qmail\*U
with no arguments, you enter the shell in curses mode if you have mail.
If you have no mail, you are told so, and the shell does not start.
If you want to enter curses mode even if
you don't have mail, use the \-S option on the command line.
.PP
In curses mode, the user's terminal has its \*Qecho\*U turned off so commands
that are issued are not echoed on the screen.
Certain commands cause the mode
to return to normal for typing purposes (sending mail, for example).
In normal operation, the screen displays the current set of message
headers, the current message number is in the top left corner, the
mail status on the top line, and the cursor is placed on the current
message.
The number of message headers displayed is set by the variable
.BR screen .
If the user does not have that variable set, the baud rate is checked and
the size of the screen is set according to optimal refresh time.
Usually, 300 baud gives 7 lines, 1200 gives 14, 2400 gives 22 lines, and all
higher baud rates give the size of the screen, whatever that may be.
Note that the top line is reserved for \*Qstatus\*U and the bottom line is
for user interaction should it be required.
.PP
The user may now type commands via key sequences that are not echoed
to the screen.
Thus, function keys may be bound to \*Qcommands\*U by using the 
.B bind
command.
A list of key-to-command bindings can be found at runtime by typing `?'
in curses mode or by using the
.B bind
command in line mode.
.PP
The commands to which you can map sequences are intended to be as self
explanatory as possible, but admittedly, it might be easier to figure out
via trial and error than to try to wade through this documentation.
A list of the legal curses commands can be obtained when executing the
bind command.
Regular tty line-mode commands are not issued from
the curses interface; only special curses mode commands are understood.
The current list of valid curses commands is:
.sp
.ta 2i 4i
.in +4
.nf
alias	last-msg	saveopts	
back-msg	line-mode	screen-back	
bind	lpr	screen-next	
bind-macro	mail	search-again

copy	map!	shell-escape	
copy-list	mark	sort

.fi
.in -4
.sp
.PP
The following is a list of default key-command bindings.
If you specify bind commands in your initialization file that conflict with
these defaults, your settings override the defaults.
The default settings given in this manual
use the ^-character method to indicate control characters
(mostly because nroff makes printing the backslash
character so amazingly difficult).
Thus, `^X' means control-X even
though you have to type \*Q\\CX\*U to set
the binding and actually use the control key and the `X' key simultaneously
to really
.I do
a Control-X.
.TP
\&., t, p, T=top, n=next
Display (type/print) message.
Top displays the first
.B crt
lines of a message.
Next prints the next message.
If the current message is deleted, the next undeleted message is found.
You might notice this is different from the line mode, which returns
an error message that the current message is marked as deleted.
.TP
+, j, J, RETURN
Go to next message.
.TP
-, k, K, ^K
Go to previous message.
.TP
^, $
Go to first/last message.
.TP

Set aliases.
.TP
b, B
Set/unset bindings.
.TP
d, D, u, U
Delete/undelete messages (capitals prompt for message list).
.TP
f
Change folder.
If current folder has changed, verification for update is requested.
.TP
g, 0-9
Go directly to a specified message.
When the \*Qgoto\*U command
is selected, a prompt at the bottom of the window prompts for a
.BR "message list" .
Anything that describes a message list may be used.
Since
.I Mush
commands return message lists, a legal
.I Mush
command enclosed in backquotes may be used to go to a particular message.
The new current message pointer points to the next
message, returned by the command, that is below the old current message.
An example:
.sp
.ti +2
goto msg: `pick \-f argv`
.sp
This causes the current message to move to the first message
in the current folder from the user \*Qargv\*U that comes after the
message pointed to when the \*Qgoto\*U was issued.
So, if messages 1 and 5
are from the user \*Qargv\*U and the current message the user was on
was message 3, then the new current message is message 5, since it
is the first message found after message 3 that is from \*Qargv\*U.
If none of the messages are found after the current message, the new
current message is the first one returned by the command.
.TP
h
Set personal headers.
.TP
i
Set ignored headers.
.TP
m, M
Send mail (capital prompts for mail flags).
.TP
o, O
Order messages (sort; capital reverses order).
A prompt requests the sort constraints.
.TP
q, Q, x, X
Quit/exit.
\&`q' tests to see if the current folder has been updated and prompt
the user to verify updating.
\&`x' does not update mail, but quits the program.
\&`Q' does not prompt for update verification; if changes were
made, updating is automatic.
\&`Q' (quit!) and `X' (exit!) works even when typed at the
\*Q...continue...\*U prompt, whereas `q' and `x' do not.

.TP
/, ^/, ^N
Forward, backward, continue search for patterns.
Entire messages are not searched for here.
Only the text available on the screen is searched for.
Note that some terminals use `^_' (control-underscore) for `^/',
so you may wish to re-bind this key.
.TP
&&
Create a curses mode macro.
.TP
&:
Create a line mode macro.
.TP
&!
Create a composition mode macro.
.TP
:[cmd]
Enter line mode for one command.
History is not recorded for this escape,
and line mode macros are not available.
If no command is given, curses mode
is exited and the session continues in line mode
(in which case history and macros become available).
.PP
When setting new key sequences to be bound to commands, the user may
use control keys and the ESCAPE character for extended commands.
Exceptions are control-C, control-\\, and possibly other control characters
depending on your system's configuration or your current tty mode settings.
.PP
When assigning key sequences to commands, the user enters the
.B bind
command and prompting is done.
If the
user wishes to have control characters or the escape character in a key
sequence while still using ASCII format, a special notation for control
characters is provided.
This sequence is used primarily for the use of
binding control character sequences in the initialization file.
This format
is also used to display the current key-command mappings by the program.
.PP
To specify control characters in ASCII format for the bind command, the
sequence \*Q\\Cc\*U is used where `c' is the
character that the control key translates to and must be in upper case.
The sequence \*Q\\CP\*U maps to control-P.
If the user wishes to indicate the RETURN key, this is specified
with the string \*Q\\n\*U and
the tab key is specified by the string \*Q\\t\*U.
As a more complex example, on a Wyse-50 terminal, the 8th function key
outputs the three characters: control-A, H, line-feed.
To map this function key to a command, the
user must enter the sequence \*Q\\CAH\\n\*U as the key sequence,
then follow up with a valid curses command.  From then on, if the user
presses that function key,
the command mapped to it is executed.
.PP
The ESCAPE key is signified by the sequence, \*Q\\E\*U.
On a Sun-3 workstation,
the R1 key outputs the character sequence: ESC, [, 2, 0, 8, z.
The corresponding
.B bind
key sequence is \*Q\\E[208z\*U.
Restrictions are that key sequences may not contain the space character
unless bound in line mode, and can never begin with a digit.
.PP
Whenever a command is entered, other than `^L'
.RB ( redraw ),
which causes the screen to scroll or be refreshed in any way,
.I Mush
is left in the
.I continue
mode.
When in this mode, the user is given his line-mode prompt followed
by \*Q...continue...\*U indicating that he may issue a new command or
return to the top level where the current message headers are displayed
on the screen.
Remember that this is still the curses mode, but much time
is saved by avoiding redrawing the screen after each command.
The user may move up and down messages using the appropriate commands
(j/k by default) or anything else the curses mode allows.
Only the exit and quit commands return to the top level.
Because of this, there are 2 additional
ways to \*Qquit\*U from curses mode and return to the login shell.
The \*Qexit\*U and \*Qquit\*U commands quit from the top level, but
the commands
.B exit!
and 
.B quit!
are used to exit from the \*Qcontinue\*U level in the curses interface as well
as from the top level.
.PP
Note that the best way to understand the curses interface is to just use it.
In line mode, the command \*Qcurses\*U puts you into curses mode.
.SH "GRAPHICS TOOL INTERFACE"
When running the window-based tool interface, there are be five
subwindows:
a panel for folder-related commands and general options,
a scrollable display of message header summaries,
another panel of message manipulation commands,
a four-line scrollable window for warnings and output from certain commands,
and a larger window which is used for displaying messages.
The message display and command output windows can be scrolled with
the up and down cursor keys (function keys R8 and R14 by default),
and also recognize \*Qvi\*U movements (j, k, ^U, ^D, etc.),
in addition to having scrollbars.
.PP
In the header summary window, pressing the LEFT mouse button while pointing
at a message header displays that message in the large message window at the
bottom of the frame.
Pressing the middle button deletes the message, and pressing the RIGHT mouse
button displays a menu of actions that affect the message.
Possible actions are to display the message, delete or undelete it, reply to
it, save it, preserve it
(see the
.B preserve
command), or print it (hardcopy).
.PP
All panel items in the frame have labels describing their functionality.
Selecting
a panel item with the LEFT mouse button causes the action to be executed.
The RIGHT mouse button displays a menu of options that the command may
branch to.
For example, the
.B Save
panel item by default saves messages to the file \*Qmbox\*U, but the
RIGHT mouse button causes a menu to be displayed, and the choices of
where to save the message increase to include the items in the menu.
These typically include the files in the user's folder directory (see the
.B folder
variable below).
.PP
At the end of most lists of menu entries for panel items is an item
labeled \*Qhelp\*U.
When this item is chosen, an new window is opened where help for that
command is displayed.
The help windows can be scrolled in the same ways as the message
display window.
.I "Note:  The limited number of file descriptors in SunOS 3.5 forces"
Mush
.I "to display help information in the"
.IR "message window in the main frame" .
.\" Some nroffs can't handle long .IR arguments
.PP
When composing letters,
a separate frame is created which includes a panel of command items,
a four-line scrollable window,
and a large window for editing the letter.
Panel items for including messages, editing (via your usual text editor),
sending, aborting the message, and various other manipulations are supplied.
See the section on \*QSending mail\*U, under the summary of tilde escapes,
for more details of composition frame command items.
As long as the composition frame is open, all
.I Mush
command output is
redirected from the small window in the main frame to the small window here.
\fINote:  This subwindow is not present in SunOS 3.5 due
to the limited number of file descriptors; command output stays in the
main frame in that case\fR.
The SunView
.I textsw
interface is used by default in the large window for paging and editing.
Cursor movement with the function keys (R8, R10, R12, and R14 by default)
is supported.
.SH COMMANDS
Described below are legal commands understood by
.I Mush
that you can type at the line mode prompt.
Most commands have abbreviations
(given in parentheses) and can be followed by message lists.
In most cases,
whitespace is not necessary to separate commands from message lists.
For example, \*Qd*\*U deletes all messages, and \*Qu1-7 {4}\*U undeletes
messages 1 through 7 except for message number 4.
.B NOTE:
\fIThis \*Qtoken splitting\*U may have unexpected side effects, especially
for \fRUNIX\fI commands whose names contain digits.\fR
.PP
The ability to customize commands using the
.B cmd
facility allows users to customize
.I Mush
to resemble other mailers.
However, efforts have already been made to include commands that are backwards
compatible with other line-mode mailers.
Users of the graphics tool mode of
.I Mush
may have little need for the command line mode because the icon based
interface allows interaction with many commands.
The tool mode is much more restrictive in favor of a simpler, user
friendly interface, but most useful commands may be achieved anyway.
.PP
The following is a list of all recognized commands.
Since most commands accept a
.I "message list"
as an argument, arguments are noted only when they differ from a message list.
.TP
.B about
Gives information about the authors of this wonderful software.
.TP
.BR alias " [name] [address-list]"
.ns
.TP
.BR unalias " name"
The
.B alias
command defines a name to stand for a list of addresses.
The defined name can then be substituted for the entire list when
sending mail.
For example,
.sp
.nf
.ti +2
alias dan dheller@cory.berkeley.edu argv@zipcode.com
.fi
.sp
This defines the name \*Qdan\*U to be shorthand for two addresses,
both of which happen to be Dan Heller.
.sp
The command
.B unalias
can be used to remove an alias definition.
.sp
With no arguments,
.B alias
prints out all the current aliases.
With one argument, it prints the list associated with that name,
and with more than one argument, it creates a new alias.
.\" Note: .TP may use @ as delimiter for some computations.
.\" Can't have "user@host" in the line, so use "address".  Bleah.
.TP
.BR alternates " [host-list] [*[user]] [address] [!path!user]"
.RB ( alts )
This command
is useful if you have accounts on several machines.
It can be used to inform
.I Mush
that your login name at each of the listed hosts is really you.
When you
.B reply
to messages,
.I Mush
does not send a copy of the message to your login name at any of the
hosts listed on the
.B alternates
list.  If the special symbol \*Q*\*U is used, then your login name is
matched against all pathnames and local addresses.
A user name may be appended to the \*Q*\*U, in which case that name is
matched instead of your login name.
.sp
If you have another login name on the local or remote machine, then
that login may be specified either as \*Quser@machine\*U or
by preceding the login name or a UUCP path to the login name by a `!'
character.
.sp
For example,
.sp
.nf
.ti +2
alts zipcode maui1 dheller@cory.berkeley.edu !root
.fi
.sp
are all either hostnames or pathnames to accounts owned by the same user.
The last item, \*Q!root\*U matches mail to \*Qroot\*U only if it is
destined for the local machine, e.g. a workstation.
Root accounts elsewhere are not considered to be equivalent.
The address \*Qdheller@cory.berkeley.edu\*U indicates that at the machine
\*Qcory.berkeley.edu\*U the user \*Qdheller\*U is the same person as the
current user at the local machine.
This could also have been specified in UUCP format:
.sp
.nf
.ti +2
alts !cory.berkeley.edu!dheller
.fi
.sp
The leading `!' character is required to differentiate paths ending in a
login name from those to which the user's login name should be appended.
.sp
If the
.B alternates
command is given with no arguments, the current set of alternate
names is displayed.
Names entered in \*Quser@machine\*U form are displayed in UUCP format.
Note that
.B alternates
is not cumulative; any arguments given to the
.B alternates
command removes the current list and replace it.
.TP
.BR await " [\-T timeout]"
Directs the shell to wait for the arrival of new mail.
New mail is checked approximately every 30 seconds, or every
.I timeout
seconds as specified by the \-T option.
This command does not return until new mail arrives
or until a keyboard interrupt (^C) is typed.
Unless the string \*Qawait\*U appears in the value of the variable
.BR quiet ,
the terminal bell rings when
.B await
reads in a new message (see the VARIABLES section for details).
.TP
.BR bind " [string [command [parameters]]]"
.ns
.TP
.BR unbind " string"
.rs
Bind the sequence of keystrokes specified by
.I string
to the curses-mode function,
.IR command .
The
.I string
is usually one or two characters, or a sequence sent by
one of the \*Qfunction keys\*U of a particular terminal.
See the CURSES INTERFACE section for a complete list of curses-mode
functions; this interface is not available on all systems.
The
.I parameters
are currently recognized only for the special
.B macro
function; see the
.B bind-macro
command for details.
.sp
If no arguments are given to
.BR bind ,
the current set of curses bindings are listed;
if only a
.I string
argument is given, the binding for that string is listed;
and if both a
.I string
and a
.I command
are given, a curses binding is created such that when the
.I string
is typed in curses mode, the function specified by
.I command
is executed.
.sp
Bindings can be removed by using the
.B unbind
command.
.TP
.BR bind-macro " [string [expansion]]"
This command is an abbreviation, which invokes the
.B bind
command with the special function
.B macro
as the second argument.
The effect of binding a curses macro is that whenever the
.I string
is typed in curses mode, the effect is the same as if the
.I expansion
had been typed instead.
A special syntax is provided for including non-printing (control)
characters in both the
.I string
and the
.IR expansion ;
see the CURSES INTERFACE section and the MACROS section for details.
.sp
If no arguments are given,
.B bind-macro
lists the current curses mode macros.
It is otherwise identical to
.in +4
.B bind
.I string
.B macro
.IR expansion .
.in -4
.TP
.B cd
Change the working directory to that specified, if given.
If no directory is given, then changes to the user's home directory.
.TP
.BR cmd " [name [command]]"
.ns
.TP
.BR uncmd " name"
.rs
Command line aliases are set and unset using these commands.
More extensive information is given in the LINE-MODE INTERFACE section.
.B Uncmd
may take `*' as an argument to uncmd everything set.
.TP
.BR curses " [off]"
The
.B curses
command causes
.I Mush
to change from the line-oriented mode to the screen-oriented (curses)
mode, as described above in the CURSES INTERFACE section.
This command may not be given when curses mode is already active.
When used in an initialization file (such as
.IR .mushrc )
this command is the same as giving the \-C (\-curses) switch on the
.B mush
command line.
.sp
The argument
.I off
may be used
.I only
in initialization files, including those read with \-I (\-init),
and has the effect of turning off the \-C switch.
.I Off
is ignored at all other times, even in files read with \-F (\-source).
.TP
.BR debug " [N]"
Set debugging level to N (1 by default).
When in debug mode, the user can see some of the flow of
control the program makes while executing.
The intent of the debug level is for tracking down
bugs with the program at specific locations.
Occasionally, the program may segmentation fault and core dump.
When this happens, the user can reenter the program,
set the debugging level and recreate the problem.
.sp
If the user suspects memory allocation problems, a debugging
level of 5 or higher prevents memory from being freed so that
memory bounds won't get overwritten.
.sp
If the user suspects Mail Transport Agent errors,
a debugging level of 3 or higher prevents the MTA from starting
and outgoing mail is directed to the standard output instead of actually
being sent.
.TP
.BR delete / undelete
.RB ( d / u )
Takes a message list as argument and marks them all as deleted.
Deleted messages are not saved in
.IR mbox ,
nor are they be available for most other commands.
If the folder has not been updated, deleted messages can be recovered
with
.BR undelete .
.TP
.B dp
(also
.BR dt )
Deletes the current message and prints (types) the next message.
.TP
.BR echo " [-n] [-h | -p] arguments"
Echoes all the arguments given on the command line, expanding variables
and history references.  If the -n flag is given, then no newline is appended.
If the -h flag is given, then echo looks for formatting parameters
as if the "from" command were given on the "current" message.
If the -p flag is given, then echo looks for formatting parameters
as if your prompt were changed temporarily.
.sp
Examples:
.sp
.nf
.ti +2
echo -h This message is from %a and is dated %d.
.br
might produce:
.ti +2
This message is from zipcode!argv and is dated Dec 14, 1988.
.sp
.ti +2
echo -p There are %n new messages to read in %F.
.br
might produce:
.ti +2
There are 5 new messages to read in /usr/spool/mail/argv.
.fi
.sp
Note that -h and -p cannot be specified together.
.TP
.B edit\ \ 
.RB ( e ,
.BR v )
This function lets you edit messages in your folder.  When editing messages,
be careful not to remove certain message headers such as Date or From or
any others that looks important.  If you remove or change something you
shouldn't have, you are notified and the temporary file used to edit
the message is not removed.
.TP
.BR eval " [\-h | \-p] arg ..."
As in most shells, the list of arguments to
.B eval
is re-parsed and then executed as a command.
This is useful primarily for causing multiple levels of variable expansion.
.sp
If the \-h option is given,
.B eval
expands header format strings in the argument list before executing the
command.
Similarly, the \-p option expands prompt format strings in the argument
list before executing.
These formats are expanded \fIlast\fR, after all history and variable
expansion is completed, and are implicitly quoted, so embedded quotes,
spaces, tabs, `!'s, etc. are handled correctly.
Header formats are expanded using the 
.I current
message.
For example,
.sp
.ti +2
eval \-h pick \-f %a
.sp
finds all messages from the same author as the current message.
See the the entries for
.I hdr_format
and
.I prompt
in the VARIABLES section for more details.
.sp
Note that -h and -p cannot be specified together.
.TP
.B exit\ \ 
.RB ( x )
Terminates
.I Mush
immediately without modifying the current folder or system spool directory.
In scripts and initialization files,
.B exit
is handled specially and discontinues the file without leaving the program.
However,
.I x
terminates the program as usual.
.TP
.BR expand " alias-list"
Aliases, given as arguments, are expanded as they are when you
send mail to each.
Nested alias references are fully expanded.
.TP
.BR flags " [ [ + | \- ] [ D f N O P p R r S U ] ] [msg-list]"
This command modifies the flag bits set on the listed messages.
It should not normally be needed, but is provided to allow users, through
the
.B cmd
facility, to alter the ways that certain conditions are recorded.
Multiple flag bits may be set or modified at once.
The modifiable flag bits are:
.sp
.nf
.ta 2i
.in +4
D	deleted
f	forwarded
N	new
O	old
P	preserved
p	printed
R	read
r	replied-to
S	saved
U	unread
.in -4
.fi
.sp
If a `+' or `\-' is included in the list of bits, the specified bits are
turned on or off respectively, without modifying other bits.
If no `+' or `\-' is given, then the list of bits is set explicitly and
all other bits are lost.
The `\-' modifier can be escaped with a backslash (i.e., \*Q\\\-\*U) to
prevent its interpretation as part of a message range, or it may be given
\fIafter\fR the list of bits for the same reason.
.sp
Message lists can be piped to or from the
.B flags
command; for example, you may use
.sp
.nf
.ti +4
cmd r 'flags \\!* + r | reply'
.fi
.sp
to mark as
.I replied-to
all messages included in a reply.
.TP
.BR folder " [\-N] [-n] [\-r] [ %[user] | # | & | file ]"
.RB ( fo )
Change current folder.
With no arguments, prints the name of the current folder.
The arguments are:
.nf
.ta 1i
.in +2
\-N	No headers are displayed upon entering new folder
\-n	The current folder is not updated
\-r	Set Read-Only mode (can't alter new folder)
%[user]	Change to /usr/spool/mail/[user] (default is yours)
#	Switch back to the previous folder
&	Change folder to $mbox (default is ~/mbox)
.in -2
.fi
.sp
File names that do not begin with `/' are interpreted relative to the current
directory unless they begin with one of the metacharacters `+' or `~'.
As in
.IR csh ,
the character `~' expands to the user's home directory (or to some other
user's home directory if used as \*Q~username\*U).
The character `+' is expanded to the name of the user's
.I folder
directory (defaults to \*Q~/Mail\*U or the value of the variable
.BR folder ).
For compatibility with other mailers, no `/' character needs to appear
between the `+' and the name of the folder (see \*QFilename metacharacters\*U
in the LINE-MODE INTERFACE section).
.sp
This command can only appear in a pipeline if it is the first command;
it returns a list of all the messages in the new folder.
This command cannot be used in initialization files before the shell
has started.
.sp
For compatibility with older versions, the argument `!' with
no leading `\-' is interpreted as \-n.
.TP
.B folders
List the names of the folders in your folder directory.
Your folder directory is the directory
.I Mail
in your home directory.
Or, you can set the variable
.B folder
to specify another folder directory.
.br
.TP
.BR from " [ + | \- ] [msg-list] [pattern]"
.RB ( f )
With no arguments,
.B from
prints the current message's header summary (see the variable
.BR hdr_format ).
If given a pattern,
.B from
prints the headers of those messages whose \*QFrom:\ \*U lines
match the pattern.
When a message list precedes the pattern, or when a message list is
supplied by a pipeline, the search is restricted to that list.
If only a message list is given (or piped),
.B from
prints the headers of the listed messages.
.sp
The special arguments `\-' and `+' can be given to move the
current message pointer to the previous or next message,
respectively, while also printing that message's header.
If a message list was given in addition to `\-' or `+', then
the current message pointer is set to the first or last
message, respectively, in the message list given.
Examples:
.sp
.ti +2
from + Dan
.sp
prints the headers of all messages that contain \*QDan\*U in
in the author's name and set the current message pointer to
the last one of that kind in the list.
.sp
.ti +2
from \- 10-30 {16}
.sp
prints the headers of messages 10 through 30 except for
message 16 and set the current message pointer to 10.
.sp
.ti +2
from +
.sp
prints the header of the message after the current message
and increments the current message pointer to the next message.
.sp
.ti +2
from $
.sp
prints the last message's header but does not move the current
message pointer.
.TP
.BR headers " [ [\-H][:c] ] [ + | \- ]"
.RB ( h ,
.BR z )
Prints a screenful of message headers listed in the
current folder.
If a message number is given on the command line,
the first message of the screenful of messages is
that message number.
The `z' command is identical to the \*Qh +\*U
command and remains for compatibility reasons.
The variable
.B screen
may be set to tell how many headers are in a screenful.
In the graphics tool mode, the variable
.B screen_win
contains the number of headers used in the headers subwindow.
.sp
A typical header may look like:
.sp
.ti +2
\&>  5  N  argv@spam.istc.sri.com Feb 19, (10/278) Test
.sp
This line indicates that it is message number 5 and the `>'
indicates that the \*Qcurrent message pointer\*U is pointing to this
message.
The next two positions indicate the message status.
The first
may be one of, \*QN\*U (new and unread), \*QU\*U (old, but still
unread), \*Q*\*U (deleted), \*QS\*U (saved), \*QP\*U (preserved),
or \*Q \*U (read).
The second position may have an \*Qr\*U if the message
has been replied to, an \*Qf\*U if it has been forwarded,
or a \*Qp\*U if it has been printed.
.sp
The author of the example message header is
.IR argv@spam.istc.sri.com ,
the date is
.IR "Feb 19" ,
the number of lines in the message is
.IR 10 ,
the number of characters is
.I 278
and the subject of the message is
.IR Test .
The format of the message header shown here is described by
the string variable
.BR hdr_format .
The example given above has a hdr_format of
.sp
.ti +2
set hdr_format = "%25f %7d (%l/%c) %25s"
.sp
See the description of
.B hdr_format
in the VARIABLES section for more information on header formats.
.sp
You can print a special subset of message headers by using the
.I \-H:c
option, where `c' is one of:
.nf
.in +2
.ta 1i
.if t .ta 1.5i
a	all messages
d	deleted messages
f	forwarded messages
m	marked messages
n	new messages
o	old messages
p	preserved messages
r	replied to messages
s	saved messages
u	unread messages
.fi
.in -2
Note that the \-H is not required; \*Qheaders :c\*U is valid.
.sp
More options to the
.B headers
command include
.RI ` + '
and
.RI ` \- '.
Each prints the next or previous screenful of message headers.
The
.B z
command can also be used; `z' alone prints the next
screenful (thus, the `+' is optional)
and \*Qz \-\*U is equivalent to \*Qh \-\*U.
.sp
Headers affects all the messages it displays, so piping may be done
from the headers command.
Piping to the headers command causes the
message headers affected by the previous command to be printed.
This action is identical to piping to the
.B from
command.
.TP
.BR help " [topic]"
Help is provided on a per topic basis and on a general basis.
For general help, just typing
.I help
provides some general information as to how to get further help
and a list of topics suggested for more specific help.
There is also help provided for each command by using the \-?
option to most commands.
This option provides command line usage information as well as a
description of what the command does and how to use it.
.sp
If no help file is found, an error message is printed.
The location of the help files may be reset by setting the variables
.B cmd_help
and
.B tool_help
to the paths of the new help files.
.sp
The
.B tool_help
variable is recognized only by versions capable of using suntool mode
(tool mode need not be active).
.TP
.BR history " [\-h] [\-r] [N]"
This command displays the command history in chronological order; early
commands are printed first followed by more recent commands displayed last.
Option
.I \-h
suppresses printing of history event numbers with each history command.
Option
.I \-r
reverses the order of the history events displayed.
.sp
If a number
.I N
is given, then that number of previous commands is
echoed rather than the number set by the variable
.BR history .
.sp
See the LINE-MODE INTERFACE section for a description of referencing the
history in commands.
.TP
.BR ignore " [header-list]"
.ns
.TP
.BR unignore " [header-list]"
.rs
Display or set a list of headers to be ignored when displaying messages.
When reading messages, all the message headers are displayed with the text
body of the message.
Since these message identifier fields are cumbersome and uninteresting
in many cases, you can filter out unwanted headers by using this command.
For example,
.sp
.ti +2
ignore Received Date Message-Id
.sp
ignores the three specified fields.
Additional
.B ignore
commands are cumulative.
The command
.B unignore
is used to reverse the effects of
.BR ignore .
.sp
For another way to control this, see the variable
.BR show_hdrs .
.TP
.BR lpr " [-h] [-n] [\-Pname] [msg-list]"
Takes a message list and sends those messages, one by one, to the printer,
each separated by page feeds.
The \-h option suppresses printing of ignored headers (see the
.B ignore
command and the variables
.B show_hdrs
and
.BR alwaysignore ),
and the \-n option suppresses all headers.
A default printer name is supplied if one is not specified on the
command line
.RI (\-P printer-name ).
If you have the variable
.B printer
set, that printer name is used.
.sp
If the variable
.B print_cmd
is set, the command described by that variable is used instead
of the default system command.
In such cases, the -P option and the
.B printer
variable are ignored and the command is simply executed as is.
.sp
The \*Qprinted\*U status bit is set for each message printed by this command.
.sp
.IR Note \|:
If \*Qlpr \-Pprinter\*U produces an error message, your system administrator
may have configured
.I Mush
to require \-d in place of \-P.
.TP
.BR ls " [flags]"
This command duplicates the
.IR UNIX (TM)
command
.I /bin/ls.
By default,
.I ls
always uses the -C flag (columnate output).
.TP
.BR mail " [flags] [recipient ...]"
.RB ( m )
Send mail to a list of users.
If no recipient list is specified on the
.I Mush
command line, then a \*QTo: \*U prompt requests one.
A list of recipients must be supplied at some time before the message is
sent, but is not required to begin composing a letter.
This implementation of
.I Mush
supports mailing to files and programs as recipients.
Filenames must be full pathnames; thus, they must start with a `/' or there
is no way to know whether a recipient is a pathname or a user name.
The special characters `+' and `~' may precede pathnames since they are
expanded first to the user's folder directory (+), as described by the variable
.BR folder ,
and the user's home directory (~).
Mailing to programs is indicated by the pipe `|' character preceding the
program name.
Since the user's path is searched, full pathnames are not required for
programs that lie in the user's PATH environment variable.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.ti +2
mail username, /path/to/filename, "|program_name", +folder_name, ~user/mbox
.sp
Options are:
.nf
.in +2
.if n .ta 1.5i
.if t .ta 1.8i
\-b addr-list	set list of blind carbon recipients
\-c addr-list	set list of carbon copy recipients
\-E	edit outgoing message headers
\-e	immediately enter editor (autoedit)
\-F	add random fortune to the end of message
\-f [msg-list]	forward messages (not indented)
\-H file	read file as prepared text (no headers)
\-h file	read file as a draft (text and headers)
\-I [msg-list]	include messages with headers (indented)
\-i [msg-list]	include messages in letter (indented)
\-s [subject]	prompt for subject [set subject explicitly]
\-U	send draft immediately (use only with \-h)
\-u	unsigned: no signatures or fortunes added
\-v	verbose (passed to mail delivery program)
.in -2
.fi
.sp
The verbose option may not be available depending on the mail transport
agent on your system.
.sp
The \-e flag causes you to enter the editor described by the variable
.BR visual .
.sp
The \-E flag causes
.I Mush
to place the headers of the outgoing message in
the editor file so they can be changed.
See the description of the variable
.B edit_hdrs
for details.
.sp
The \-i flag includes the current message into the body of the
message you are about to send.
The included message is indented by
the string \*Q> \*U or by the string described by the variables
.BR indent_str ,
.BR pre_indent_str ,
and
.BR post_indent_str .
See the VARIABLES section for more information on these string values.
If a message list is given after the \-i option, then the messages
described by that list are included.
The \-I option is identical to the \-i option except that the headers of
the message are also included.
.sp
The \-s flag looks at the next argument and sets the subject to that
string.
If the string is to contain spaces, enclose the entire subject
in quotes.
If there is no following argument, then the subject is prompted for.
This flag is useful if the user:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\(bu does not have the variable \fBask\fR set, or
\(bu wishes to change the subject used with \fBreply\fR
.in -2
.fi
.sp
The subject is not prompted for and is ignored completely if the \-f flag
is specified (see below).
.sp
The \-f flag is for message forwarding only.
An optional message list can be given just as the -i option has.
The forward option does not allow you to edit the message(s) being forwarded
unless the -e flag is also specified.
The subject of the message (if available) is the same as the
.I current
message; it is not necessarily the subject of the message being forwarded.
The subject of forwarded mail cannot be changed.
However, using the \-e flag
allows the user to change the subject once in editing mode either by
using the escape sequence, \*Q~s\*U, or by editing the \*QSubject:\*U header.
.sp
Forwarded mail that has not been edited by the user contains special
headers such as
.sp
.ti +2
Resent-To:
.ti +2
Resent-From:
.sp
and perhaps others, depending on your mail transport agent.
Sendmail, for example, may add a number of other \*QResent-*\*U headers.
.sp
The \-u option, meaning \*Qunsigned\*U, prevents signatures and fortunes
from being appended to the message.
It overrides the variables
.B autosign
and 
.BR fortune ,
but affects the \-F option only if given after it on the command line.
.sp
The \-h option indicates that the given file is a previously prepared
message, possibly a partial one saved with \*Q~w\*U.
Such a file is called a \fIdraft\fR.
The file argument must be given, and
in the current implementation
all message headers must either be
present in the file or must be added manually by the user.
At minimum, there must be a \*QTo:\*U header;
.I Mush
adds \*QFrom:\*U and \*QDate:\*U headers when sending, if necessary.
To read a prepared text file that does not contain headers, use \-H.
If the \-U option is also given, then the letter is sent immediately without
further editing.
.sp
.TP
.BR map [ ! "] [string [expansion]]"
.ns
.TP
.BR unmap [ ! "] string"
.rs
The
.B map
command creates or lists macros for the line mode interface, and the
.B map!
command creates or lists macros for the message composition mode.
In either mode, macros act in such a way that, when
.I string
is typed, the effect is the same as if
.I expansion
had been typed instead.
The
.I string
is usually one or two control characters, or a sequence sent by
one of the \*Qfunction keys\*U of a particular terminal.
See the MACROS section for the syntax used to specify the
.I string
and the
.IR expansion ,
and for comments on the interactions of macros in the same and in
different modes.
.sp
If no arguments are given, these commands display the list of
macros and expansions for the appropriate mode.
If only a
.I string
is given, they display the
.I expansion
associated with that string for the appropriate mode.
Otherwise, they create a macro, associating the given
.I expansion
with the specified
.IR string .
.sp
Line mode macros are unset with the
.B unmap
command, and composition mode macros are unset with the
.B unmap!
command.
.TP
.BR mark " [\-[A|B|C|D|E]]"
.ns
.TP
.B unmark
This command places a tag on messages that you wish to reference later.
If a priority A through E is specified, that priority is assigned to the
message.
Message priorities are saved when the folder is updated.
The
.B sort
and 
.B pick
commands can then be used to order or select messages based on their
priorities.
.sp
If no pririty is specified, the message is given a temporary mark.
Messages may have both a temporary mark and a priority,
but may not have more than one priority.
Priorities are shown by the appropriate letter code immediately following the
message number in the header display.
The presence of a temporary mark is shown by a `+' character.
Temporary marks are considered to have the highest priority for sorting and
are shown in place of the regular priority if both are set on a given message.
However, temporary marks are not saved when the folder is updated.
.sp
The command
.ti +4
headers \-H:m
(abbreviated as \*Q:m\*U) can be used to generate the list of messages
with temprary marks.
.sp
For example:
.sp
.ti +4
mark -C 7
.sp
assigns priority C to message 7.  You can clear the priority of a message
by specifying a lone `\-' argument:
.sp
.ti +4
mark -
.sp
This does not remove temporary marks, only priorities.
The command
.B unmark
is used to remove temporary marks.
.TP
.BR merge " [\-N] folder-name"
Messages from the named folder are read into the current folder.
The header summaries of the merged messages are printed unless the \-N
option is given (see the
.B folder
command, above).
This command can only appear in a pipeline if it is the first command;
it returns a list of all the messages from the merged-in folder.
This command cannot be used in initialization files before the shell
has started.
.TP
.BR my_hdr " [header[: text]]"
.ns
.TP
.BR un_hdr " [header:]"
.rs
You can create personalized headers in your outgoing mail using this command.
.sp
.nf
Command usage:
.in +2
.ta 2.5i
my_hdr	print all your headers
my_hdr header	print value of header
my_hdr header: string	set header to string
un_hdr header:	unset header
.in -2
.sp
.fi
To set a header, the first argument must be a string
that contains no whitespace (spaces or tabs) and must end with
a colon (:).
The rest of the command line is taken to be the
text associated with the mail header specified.
If any quotes are used in the header and the header itself is not set in
quotes, then quotes should be escaped (preceded) by a backslash.
This holds true for semicolons, pipe characters
or any other metacharacter that
.I Mush
might interpret as a command line modifier.
.sp
If the variable
.B no_hdrs
is set, then your headers are not added to outgoing messages,
but no headers are unset.
The
.B un_hdr
command may take `*' as an argument to un_hdr everything set.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.ti +2
my_hdr Phone-Number: (415) 499-8649
.sp
.I Mush
treats the the header \*QFrom:\*U as a special case.
If you have set your own From:, a simple test is performed to determine
whether the address given is valid.
Any UUCP or domain address that directs mail to your login at the local
machine should be acceptable, but certain configurations may prevent some
combinations from being recognized.
If the address is valid, your From: header is used; otherwise, an
address known to be valid is generated and used instead.
Some mail transport agents are \*Qpicky\*U and do not allow
.I Mush
to supply a From: header; in these cases, your From: header is silently
removed at send time, and replaced with one generated by the MTA.
.sp
Note:  You cannot set the \*QDate:\*U.
Attempting to do so does not result in any
error messages; your date is simply overwritten
by the system when your mail is sent.
.TP
.BR pick " [flags] [<pattern>]"
Allows the user to select particular messages from a folder.
The <pattern> is a \*Qregular expression\*U as described by
.IR ed .
You can search for messages from a user, for a particular subject line,
between certain dates, and limit searches to a range of messages.
You can also find all messages that do not
match the same arguments mentioned above.
.sp
.nf
Options:
.ta 1.5i
.in +2
+<num>	keep only the first <num> messages matched (head).
\-<num>	keep only the last <num> messages matched (tail).
\-ago <format>	search for messages relative to today's date.
\-d [+|\-]date	messages sent on or [+ after] [`\-' before] date.
\-e	take all remaining arguments to be the pattern.
\-f	search for pattern in \*QFrom\*U field only.
\-h header	search for pattern in specified header only.
\-i	ignore case of letters when searching.
\-p priority	select messages with given priority (A,B,C,...)
\-r msg-list	search only the listed messages.
\-s	search for pattern in \*QSubject\*U field only.
\-t	search for pattern in \*QTo\*U field only.
\-x	select messages that do \fInot\fR match the pattern.
.in -2
.fi
.sp
The
.I \-ago
option can be abbreviated as
.IR \-a .
Only one of \-a, \-d, \-f, \-h, \-p, \-s and \-t can be specified at once,
but multiple \-p options may be specified to select several priorities.
Entire messages are scanned for the <pattern>
unless \-a, \-d, \-f, \-h, \-p, \-s or \-t is specified.
Messages marked for deletion are also searched.
No patterns can be specified with the \-a or \-d options.
The \-x option may not be used in conjunction with
.IR + n
(head) and
.IR \- n
(tail).
.sp
For the \-d option, \*Qdate\*U is of the form:
.sp
.ti +2
month/day/year
.sp
with an optional `\-' to specify that the messages of interest are those
older than that date.
Omitted fields of the date default to today's values.
Examples of selecting on date:
.nf
.in +2
.ta 2.0i
.sp
pick \-d 4/20	on April 20, this year.
pick \-d \-/2/85	on or before the 2nd, this month, 1985.
pick \-d +5/4	on or after May 4 of this year.
pick \-d /	today only.
.fi
.in -2
.sp
At least one `/' char must be used in a date.
There is no strong date checking; 2/30 is considered a valid date.
.sp
For the \-ago option, the format is very simple.  Specify the number of
days followed by the word \*Qdays\*U, or the number of weeks followed by
the word \*Qweeks\*U, and so on with months and years.  Truncation is allowed,
since only the first character is examined, so all of the following are
equivalent:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
pick \-ago 1 day, 2 weeks
pick \-ago 2Weeks 1Day
pick \-ago 2w,1day
pick \-a 2w1d
.fi
.in -2
.sp
These examples find all messages that are exactly 2 weeks and 1 day
old.  All \*Qago\*U dates collapse into \*Qday\*U time segments.  This
means that months are 30.5 days long.  If more precise date selection is
required, use the \-d option and specify specific dates.
.sp
Also note that the \-ago option allows
the \*Qbefore\*U (\-) and \*Qafter\*U (+)
arguments.  Thus, you may pick all messages older than 1 week with:
.sp
.ti +2
pick \-ago \-1 week
.sp
Other examples of
.B pick:
.sp
.nf
.ti +2
pick \-d 2/5/86 | pick \-d \-2/5/87 | pick \-s "mail stuff" | lpr
.fi
.sp
Will find all the messages between the dates February 5, 1986, and
February 5, 1987, that contain the subject "mail stuff" and send them
to the printer.
.sp
.ti +2
pick -s Re: | delete
.sp
Deletes messages that have \*QRe:\*U in the Subject header.
.sp
.ti +2
folder +project | pick \-f frank
.sp
Finds all messages from frank in the folder described by +project.
.sp
.ti +2
pick \-h return-path ucbvax
.sp
Searches all messages that have the header "Return-Path:" and determines
if the string \*Qucbvax\*U is in the header.
Note that case sensitivity
applies only to the pattern searched, not the header itself.
.sp
.ti +2
pick \-ago +1w | save +current
.sp
This finds all messages that are a week or less old and saves them in the file
called \fIcurrent\fR, which is found in the user's \fIfolder\fR variable.
.sp
.ti +2
pick +3 mush-users
.sp
Finds the first three messages containing the string \*Qmush-users\*U.
.sp
.ti +2
eval -h "pick +2 \-r .-$ \-s %s" | pick \-1
.sp
Finds the next message with the same subject as the current message.
.TP
.BR pipe " [\-p pattern] [msg-list] unix-command"
Allows the user to send the texts of a list of messages to a
.IR UNIX (TM)
command.
The list of messages may either be given explicitly or may come from a
.I Mush
pipeline (see \*QPiping commands\*U under the LINE-MODE INTERFACE section).
If a list is neither given nor piped, the current message is used.
All headers are considered part of the message text for purposes of this
command unless the value of the variable
.B alwaysignore
includes the word \*Qpipe\*U (see
.B alwaysignore
in the VARIABLES section for more information).
For example,
.sp
.in +4
.nf
pipe 3 5 7 patch
.fi
.in -4
.sp
sends the text and headers of messages 3, 5 and 7 to the
.I patch
utility.
.sp
If a
.I pattern
is specified with the \-p option, \fIMush\fR searches
the message for a line beginning with that string.
The matching line and all succeeding lines are sent to the
.IR unix-command .
If \-p is not given, and the
.I unix-command
is omitted, \fIMush\fR searches for a line beginning with \*Q#!\*U
and feeds that line and all succeeding lines to \*Q/bin/sh\*U.
Thus,
.B pipe
with no arguments treats the current message as a shell script.
.sp
The pattern may also be of the form
.ti +4
.I /pattern1/,/pattern2/
.br
in which case printing begins with the line containing
.I pattern1
and end with the line containing
.I pattern2
(inclusive).
Patterns of this form must still match at beginning of line, and
regular expressions are not currently allowed.
.sp
The
.B pipe
command can also be invoked as
.B Pipe
(note capitalization), in which case only the body of the messages,
and none of the message headers, are sent to the unix command.
.sp
When the variable
.B unix
is set,
.IR UNIX (TM)
commands can appear anywhere
.I except as the first command
in a 
.I Mush
pipeline without explicitly using
.BR pipe .
However, it is still necessary to specify
.B Pipe
in order to exclude all headers.
.sp
.IR Note :
All messages listed as arguments to
.B pipe
or
.B Pipe
are sent to the standard input of the
.I same
process as a continuous stream, in message number order!  This is probably
not desirable when extracting shell scripts in particular, so take care.
.TP
.B preserve
.RB ( pre )
When the system folder is updated, preserved messages are saved in that
folder rather than in your mbox folder.
The
.B preserve
command sets this preserved status on the listed messages unless they have
been explicitly deleted.
The variable
.B hold
causes all messages (except those saved or deleted) to be held in your
system folder automatically.
.TP
.B print
.RB ( p ,
.BR type ,
.BR t )
Takes a message list and displays each message on the user's terminal.
If the first letter of the command is a capital letter (`P' or `T')
then \*Qignored\*U headers are not ignored
.I provided
that the variable
.B alwaysignore
is either not set or is set to one of its possible values.
If this variable is set with no value, the ignored headers are
ignored regardless of the command used to display the message.
See the
.B ignore
command for more information about ignored message headers.
.sp
The `+' and the `\-' keys can be used to display the \*Qnext\*U
and \*Qprevious\*U messages respectively.
The `+' key has the caveat that the
message is not paged at all and none of the messages headers are displayed.
.TP
.B pwd
Prints the current working directory.
.TP
.B quit\ \ 
.RB ( q )
Updates the current folder and exits from
.IR Mush .
If the current folder is your system folder and the variable \*Qhold\*U is
set, all messages not marked for deletion are left in your system folder.
Otherwise, messages that have been read are saved to
.I ~/mbox
or to the file described by the string variable
.BR mbox .
Messages marked for deletion are discarded.
Unread messages are copied back to the current folder in all cases.
.TP
.BR reply / replyall " [msg-list] [-r path] [flags] [users]"
.RB ( r / R )
Messages are replied to by sending mail to the sender of each message
in the given message list.
The command
.B replysender
is equivalent to
.BR reply .
.B Replyall
responds to all the recipients as well as the sender of the message.
These commands understand all the same flags as the
.B mail
command.
.sp
When constructing a return mail address to the author of a message,
.B reply
searches for special mail headers in the author's message that
indicate the most efficient mail path for return mail.
.I Mush
searches for the \*QReply-To:\*U,
\*QFrom:\*U, and \*QReturn-Path:\*U headers, in that order, by default.
.sp
If none of these fields are found in the message, the first line of the
message is parsed if possible;
this \*QFrom\ \*U line is different from the \*QFrom:\ \*U line.
If the user wishes to change the order or the actual fields to search for
return paths, then the variable
.B reply_to_hdr
may be set to a list of headers to be used (in the order specified).
If it is set, but has no value, the first \*QFrom\ \*U line is used
regardless of what headers the author's message contains.
The \*QFrom\ \*U line may be specified explicitly as an item in the
list of reply-to headers by specifying the header \*Q\fBFrom_\fR\*U.
See the VARIABLES section for more information about
.B reply_to_hdr.
.sp
When replying to all recipients of the message using the
.B replyall
.RB ( R )
command, only the original author's address can be obtained from
the message headers.
There is no way to determine the best path to the
other recipients of the message from message headers aside from taking
their addresses directly from the \*QTo:\*U and \*QCc:\*U lines.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.ti +2
replyall 3,4,5 -i 4,5 7 -s response mail-group
.sp
Here, messages 3, 4 and 5 are replied to (all the authors are obtained
from each of those messages as well as the recipients from those messages)
and the text from messages 4, 5 and 7 are included in the body of the reply.
The subject is set to "response" and the alias mail-group is appended to
the list of recipients for this message.
.sp
The -r flag prefixes the address of each recipient in the address list
with the indicated path.  This overrides the value of \fBauto_route\fR,
but has the exact same functionality.  See the explanation of the variable
in the VARIABLES section.  Also see the MAIL ADDRESSES section for more
information concerning replying to messages.
.nf
.TP
.BR save / write / copy " [\-f] [\-s | \-a] [msg-list] [filename / directory]"
.fi
.RB ( s / w )
With no arguments,
.B save
and
.B write
saves the current message to the file
.I mbox
in the user's home directory (or the file specified by the
.B mbox
variable).
If a message list is given, then the messages specified by
the list are saved.
If a filename is given, then that filename is used instead of mbox.
The \-s option forces the filename used to be that of the subject of
the message.  Similarly, the \-a option causes the filename used to be
that of the author of the message being saved.  If more than one message
is being saved, the subject or author name used is that of the smallest
message number.  With these two options, a directory name may be given
to specify a directory other than the current directory where the files
are to be created.
.sp
If the file exists and is writable, the specified command
appends each message to the end of the file.
If \-f is given, then the file is overwritten causing whatever contents it
contains to be lost.
For compatibility with older versions, the character `!' may be substituted
for \-f (no `\-' is used with `!').
Note that \-f has no effect when used with \-a or \-s.
.sp
If the current folder is the system mailbox, then saved messages are
marked for deletion when the user exits using the
.B quit
command.
If the variable
.I keepsave
is set or the current folder is not the system mailbox, then messages are
not marked for deletion.
.sp
The
.B write
command differs from
.B save
and
.B copy
in that the message headers are
.I not
saved in the file along with the body of text.
The
.B copy
command is is like
.B save
except that messages are never marked for deletion, whether or not
.B keepsave
is set.
.sp
.IR Note :
The permission mode of files created by these commands allow read and
write only by the owner of the file.
The permissions of existing files are not changed when messages are
saved or written to those files.
.TP
.BR saveopts " [file]"
The complement of
.BR source ,
.BR saveopts ,
saves all settable variables, aliases
and cmd's in the initialization file.
(See the INITIALIZATION
section for more information on initialization files.)
If an argument is given, that file is used.
Beware that this overwrites files, so any \*Qif\*U expressions
are lost, as are settings that have changed since entering
.IR Mush .
Using saveopts is highly discouraged
and is intended for the naive user only.
.TP
.BR set " [[?]variable [= value]]"
.ns
.TP
.BR unset " variable"
.rs
With no arguments,
.B set
prints all variable values.
Otherwise, it sets the named
.IR variable .
Arguments are of the form \*Qvariable=value\*U (whitespace is allowed).
Boolean options such as
.I autoedit
need not have \*Q=value\*U associated in the command.
Multivalued variables are set in the same way as other variables, and
the list of values should be enclosed in quotes if whitespace is used
to separate the items.
See the VARIABLES section for details of the format of each type of variable.
.sp
The special command
.sp
.ti +2
set ?all
.sp
prints all known variables utilized by the program and a brief
description of what they do.
The user may set and manipulate his own set of variables, but internal
variables that are utilized by the program are the only ones displayed.
.sp
The command
.sp
.ti +2
set ?variable_name
.sp
prints the same information for one variable instead of all variables.
You may unset everything by issuing the command \*Qunset *\*U.
Note that some variables are essential to the operation of the program
and are restored to a default value even when they are explicitly unset.
.sp
It is possible to set a variable to a list of messages returned by another
command by using the piping mechanism.  For example,
.sp
.ti +2
pick \-s Status Reports | set reports
.sp
The variable
.I reports
now contains a message list which can be used
as the message list argument to any command which accepts a list.
.sp
.ti +2
mail \-i $reports boss
.sp
This command sends mail to \*Qboss\*U and includes the text of all the
messages held in the \fIreports\fR variable.
.TP
.BR sh " [command]"
Invokes an interactive version of the shell.
The shell spawned is described by the variable
.BR shell .
If the optional argument
.I command
is given, then that command is executed under the Bourne Shell (/bin/sh).
If the special character `&' is at the end of any shell command,
then the command is executed in background.
.TP
.BR source " [file]"
Read
.I Mush
commands from a file.
If no filename is specified, the files searched
for are .mushrc or .mailrc in the user's home directory.
If the environment variable
.I MUSHRC
or
.I MAILRC
is set, then the file named by the variable is sourced instead.
If a filename is given on the command line, that file is sourced.
See the INITIALIZATION heading and the
.B home
variable descriptions for more information.
.TP
.BR sort " [\-i] [[\-r] \-a | \-d | \-l | \-p | \-R | \-s | \-S]"
This command sorts messages according to author, date, status or subject
(with or without considering the \*QRe:\ \*U, in replied messages).
In addition, the messages can be sorted in reverse order (same arguments).
.sp
.nf
Options:
.in +2
.ta 1i
\-i	ignore case in alphabetical sorts
\-r	reverse sort order of next option
\-a	sort by author (alphabetical)
\-d	sort by date
\-l	sort by length of message
\-p	sort by message priority
\-R	sort by subject including \*QRe:\*U
\-s	sort by subject (alphabetical)
\-S	sort by message status
.in -2
.fi
.sp
By default (no arguments),
.B sort
sorts messages by
.IR status .
New, unread messages are first, followed by preserved messages,
and finally deleted messages are placed at the end of the list.
If status is otherwise the same, priority is used to order the messages.
If \-r is the only option given, the status ordering is reversed.
.sp
Sorting by priority orders marked messages first, followed by messages
having a priority setting (A having higher precedence than B, and so on),
and finally messages having neither a mark nor a priority.
See the
.B mark
command for information on attaching marks and priorities to messages.
.sp
When sorting by date, the boolean variable
.B date_received
is checked.  If it is set, then sorting goes by date received.
Otherwise (default), sorting is by date sent by the original author.
.sp
If more than one sort option is specified, they are applied in
left-to-right sequence to each comparison.
Thus:
.sp
.ti +2
sort \-a \-d
.sp
sorts messages by author and, if the author of any set of messages
is the same, sorts within that set by date.
Note that the \-r option applies to only one other option at a time;
to reverse the sort of both author and date requires:
.sp
.ti +2
sort \-r \-a \-r \-d
.sp
The options can also be grouped:
.sp
.ti +2
sort \-ra \-rd
.ti +2
sort \-rard
.sp
Currently, only the line mode interface supports multiple sort criteria,
but the other interfaces allow subsorting indirectly
when appropriate actions are taken, as discussed below.
.sp
It is also possible to sort a consecutive sublist of messages by using pipes.
If the mailbox is already sorted by author,
.sp
.ti +2
pick \-f argv@zipcode.com | sort \-s
.sp
finds all messages from the user \*Qargv@zipcode.com\*U
and sort them by subject.
You may specify the exact message list by specifying
that message list on the command line and using a pipe:
.sp
.ti +2
10\-. | sort d
.sp
This command means to sort the messages from 10 to the current message
according to the date.
.sp
To specify subsorting from with the curses interface, the temporary
curses escape key must be used (the colon `:') and the command issued
at the `:' prompt (as if giving an \*Qex\*U command to \*Qvi\*U).
When the command is finished, the \*Q...continue...\*U prompt is given and
the user may continue or return to the top level of the curses mode.
.sp
In the tool mode, subsorting can be specified only by typing message numbers
in the \*QRange:\*U item at the top of the main frame, before selecting the
\*QSort\*U item.
The sort range must consist of consecutive messages.
Reversed sorting is not currently available in tool mode.
.sp
If the variable
.I sort
is set, messages are sorted each time the user's system mailbox is
read as the current folder.
The
.I sort
variable can be set either to nothing or to legal "sort" arguments.
.sp
\fINote\fR:  For compatibility with older versions, sort options are
recognized even if they are not preceded by a `\-'.
Also, if a `\-' is given by itself (separated by spaces from any following
arguments) it is interpreted as \-r.
.TP
.B stop\ \ 
For systems with job control, stop causes
.I Mush
to send a SIGTSTP to itself.
The command was introduced to facilitate
the stop-job action from a complex command line alias rather than the user
having to type his stop character explicitly.
.TP
.B top
Takes a message list and prints the top few lines of each.
The number of lines printed is controlled by the variable
.B toplines
and defaults to the size of the value of the variable
.B crt.
This command is ignored in the tool mode.
.TP
.BR undigest " [-m] [-p pattern] [msg-list] [filename]"
A \*Qdigest\*U is a mail message which is a collection of other mail messages
mailed to a \*Qmoderator\*U by other users.  The moderator compiles all the
messages into a folder and sends the result to all the subscribers of the
mailing list.  The
.B undigest
command disassembles the entries into the set of messages which comprises
the digest.
.sp
The -m option merges these messages into the current folder.  Otherwise,
if a filename is specified, a new folder is created and the user can change
folders to read the messages separately.
.sp
The -p option specifies an alternate pattern to be used as the digest
article separator.
This pattern must match literally at the beginning of the line.
The default pattern is \*Q\-\|\-\|\-\|\-\|\-\|\-\|\-\|\-\*U (eight hyphens).
This is the defacto USENET standard digest article separator and should
work for most digests, but some use another separator.
The -p option is also useful for \*Qbursting\*U forwarded messages out
of a wrapper message; for example:
.sp
.ti +4
undigest -m -p "--- Forward"
.sp
bursts out messages forwarded by another user of
.I Mush
and merges them into the current folder.
.sp
If a message list is specified, each digest in the list is disassembled to
the same filename (if given).
If no filename is given and the user did not request
a merge, then a temporary file is made.
The name of the temporary file is generated from the subject of the digest.
.TP
.BR update " [-r]"
Updates your current folder, writing back changes just as if you had
.BR quit ,
except that the `N'ew status does not change to `U'nread.
Headers are not listed when the folder is read back in.
The \-r option puts the folder into read-only mode
.I after
updating it.
.sp
See the
.BR folder
command for complete information.
.sp
.SH VARIABLES
Shell variables are controlled via the
.B set
and
.B unset
commands.
Options may be either boolean, in which case it is only
significant to see whether or not they are set;
string, in which case the actual value is of interest;
numerical, in which case the numerical value is important;
or multivalued, in which case they may be set to a list of values.
Some variables may have attributes
of boolean and string or multivalued at the same time.
.PP
If you or the program references a variable that is not explicitly set,
then the environment variables are checked and that data is returned.
A few variables (notably
.BR prompt ,
.BR cmd_help ,
and
.BR tool_help )
do not check the environment.
.PP
Variable values can be modified by one of four variable modifiers, or by a
numeric string.
The modifiers `:h', `:t', `:l' and `:u' may be applied to the variable names.
The current implementation allows only one `:' modifier on each `$' expansion.
.TP
:t
The variable is treated as a file path name, and the name of the file
(the \*Qtail\*U of the path) is substituted for the variable.
That is, everything to the right of the last `/'
is returned.
.TP
:h
The variable is treated as a path name, and the \*Qhead\*U of the pathname
is substituted for the variable.
That is, everything up to, but not including, the last `/' is returned.
.TP
:l
All alphabetic characters in the variable's value are converted to lower case.
.TP
:u
All alphabetic characters in the variable's value are converted to upper case.
.TP
.RI : number
The value of the variable is converted to a list of space-separated words,
which are numbered from one (1), and the word described by
.I number
is selected and returned.
It is not an error for
.I number
to be greater than the actual number of words; an empty string is returned
in this case.
.PP
Following is a list of all variables with predefined meanings.
.TP
.B alwaysignore
(Boolean/Multivalued)
If set with no value, the mail headers set by the
.B ignore
command are always ignored.
Normally, ignored headers are not ignored when sending messages to
the printer, when interpolating messages into letters with ~f or ~I,
when the `P' or `T' command is given (see the \fBprint\fR command),
or with the \-I flag to the
.B mail
or
.B reply
commands.
Setting
.B alwaysignore
ignores those headers even in the situations mentioned here.
No headers can be ignored during updates and when using the
.B save
command since the user may ignore headers that are required by
.I Mush
or any other mail system to read those folders.
.sp
This variable can also be set to a list of words
separated by commas or spaces.
Currently recognized words, and their meanings, are:
.nf
.ta 1.5i
.in +4
.\" \& escapes are to make obvious the tab after each word
forward\&	Ignore headers when forwarding messages (~f).
include\&	Ignore headers when including messages (~I).
pipe\&\&	The \fBpipe\fR command ignores headers.
printer\&	The \fBlpr\fR command ignores headers.
.in -4
.fi
.sp
Also see the
.B ignore
command and the
.B show_hdrs
variable for more information.
.TP
.B ask
(Boolean)
If set, you are prompted for a subject header for outgoing mail.
Use the tilde escape \*Q~s\*U to set the header once in the message
or specify the \-s option on the
.B mail
command line at the
.I Mush
prompt.
.TP
.B askcc
(Boolean)
If set, you are prompted for a Cc (carbon copy) list when you are
finished editing a letter to be sent.
If the variable
.B edit_hdrs
is set, prompting does not occur, but a Cc: line is added to the
edit file.
This also applies to the tool mode.
.TP
.B autodelete
(Boolean)
When exiting mail, all messages that have been read
.I "regardless of whether they have been marked for deletion"
are removed.
Only messages that haven't been read or that have been marked as
.B preserved
are not removed.
.TP
.B autoedit
(Boolean)
If set, you are automatically put into your editor whenever you
send or reply to mail.
.TP
.B autoinclude
(Boolean)
When replying to any mail, a copy of the message being replied to
is automatically inserted into your message body indented by
the string described by the variable
.BR indent_str .
.TP
.B autoprint
(Boolean)
After you delete a message, the next message is printed automatically.
.TP
.B auto_route
(Boolean/String)
If set boolean (not to a string), all the recipients in a message that
is being replied to (via \fBreplyall\fR), is routed through the path
back to the original author.
.sp
For example, if the original sender of a message came from the remote host
.B c3p0
and the list of recipients looked like
.sp
.nf
.in +2
From: c3p0!user1
To: yourhost!you
Cc: r2d2!user2, r2d2!user3
.in -2
.fi
.sp
then clearly, \*Quser1\*U on the machine c3p0 can talk to your machine
and the machine named r2d2.
However, you would not be able to respond to those users if your machine
did not exchange UUCP mail with the host r2d2.
.sp
.I Mush
attempts to solve this problem by reconstructing the addresses
for \*Quser2\*U and \*Quser3\*U according to the address of the original
sender, \*Qc3p0\*U.
The new addresses for \*Quser2\*U and \*Quser3\*U should therefore become
.sp
.ti +2
c3p0!r2d2!user2, c3p0!r2d2!user3.
.sp
If your machine not only talks to c3p0,
but talks to r2d2 as well, it becomes unnecessary to route the mail
through both c3p0 and r2d2.
So, the variable
.B known_hosts
may be set to a list of hosts which you know your machine to have
UUCP mail connections with.
This list is checked when constructing mail addresses for replies only and
the shortest path is made by removing from the UUCP path those hosts
that do not need to be called or are redundant.
See the entry for
.B known_hosts
for more information.
.sp
If
.B auto_route
is set to a specific \fBpathname\fR (host names separated by !'s),
all addresses in the reply have this route prepended to their addresses.
This ignores the original path of the author.  This is quite useful for
hosts which talk uucp to a node which is connected to the internet or uunet
since both of those machines tend to be one-hop away from all other hosts
(or reroute accordingly).  For example, if a message was addressed like so:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
To: root@ucbvax.berkeley.edu, argv@zipcode.uucp
Cc: ucbcad!foo!bar
.sp
.fi
.in -2
If auto_route is set to "ucbcad", then replies to this address are
directed addressed like so:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
To: ucbcad!ucbvax.berkeley.edu!root, ucbcad!zipcode.uucp!argv
Cc: ucbcad!foo!bar
.sp
.fi
.in -2
.sp
This assumes that the host in question talks uucp with ucbcad.  This example
demonstrates several things.  First, notice that all addresses are converted
to uucp-style format.  Whenever routing is changed, the format is converted
like this.  Secondly, note that the Cc: line did not change.  This is because
all redundant hostnames from UUCP pathnames are removed
to avoid unnecessary UUCP connections and speed up mail delivery.
.sp
Another example of how auto_route truncates UUCP paths:
.sp
.ti +2
pixar!island!sun!island!argv
.sp
Here, mail was probably originally sent to users at pixar and sun from
somewhere undetermined now.
Since sun and pixar do not talk to each other, the users on those machines may
have responded to mail creating the type of addresses stated above.
Here, it can be seen that we can reduce the path to the host
.IR island :
.sp
.ti +2
pixar!island!argv
.sp
See the MAIL ADDRESSES section for more detailed information
about legal mail addresses.
.sp
Note that the -r flag to \fBreply\fR and \fBreplyall\fR overrides the
value of \fBauto_route\fR.
.TP
.B autosign
(Boolean/string)
Append a signature to outgoing mail.
If this variable is set, but not to a string (e.g., boolean-true)
then the file ~/.signature is used.
.sp
Otherwise, the variable is interpreted in one of four ways.
By default, the string is interpreted as a pathname relative to the
.I current
directory.
For this reason, it is advisable to use full pathnames here.
As usual, the special characters `~' and `+' are expanded.
If a file is found, it is opened and its contents are read into the
message buffer.
.sp
If the variable is set to a string that begins with `$', then that string
is interpreted as a user-definable variable and is expanded and appended
to the letter.
.sp
If the variable is set to a string that begins with a backslash (\\)
then the string itself (minus the `\\' character) is used; no expansion
is done and no files are read.
.sp
Finally, if the variable is set to a string that begins with a vertical
bar (or \*Qpipe\*U) character (|), the rest of the string is interpreted
as a command whose output is used as the signature.
The special characters `~' and `+' are NOT expanded in the command name,
but the command is run via /bin/sh so $PATH is searched and redirection
can be specified.
The list of addresses to which the letter is sent is passed to
the command as its arguments, in the same form that they are passed
to the Mail Transport Agent (MTA).
Depending on your MTA, each address may be followed by a comma.
.sp
In the latter three cases, it is advisable to set the variable using single
quotes to protect the `$', `\\' and `|' characters from being interpreted.
Examples:
.sp
.nf
.ti +2
set autosign = '$foo'
.ti +2
set autosign = '\\  Dan Heller zipcode!argv@ucbcad.berkeley.edu'
.\" Need a pipe example?
.fi
.sp
.BR Warning :
if redirection from the calling shell is used,
no signature or fortune is added to outgoing mail.
For example,
.sp
.ti +2
% mush \-s report manager < report_file
.sp
In this command, mail is being sent to the user \*Qmanager\*U and the
subject is set to \*Qreport\*U and the file \*Qreport_file\*U is being
redirected as input.
In this case, \fIno\fR signature is appended.
.sp
.IR Note :
The `|' syntax for calling a program to sign the letter is a little
counterintuitive and may change in future releases.
.TP
.B autosign2
(String)
This alternate signature is available for special cases where the default
signature is not desired or if no signature is desired for special addresses
or if only special addresses require a signature.
The format for this variable is:
.sp
.ti +2
autosign2 = \*Qaddress1, address2, ... : <signature>\*U
.sp
Each address can be one of these types:
.RS
.TP
1)  address
Legal mailing addresses that do not contain comment
fields (see the sections MAIL ADDRESSES for more information on legitimate
mail addresses) match literally.
.TP
2)  *username
If the username is present on the recipient list, regardless of what
remote site the user may reside on (including locally), the pattern matches.
.TP
3)  !hostname !host1!host2...
Any user who appears as a recipient matches the pattern provided he
resides on the specified hostname.
If a path of hosts is specified, then the user must reside on the last
host of the specified path.
.\" Nroff note: there is a problem with the @sub.domain line,
.\" because .TP uses @ as a delimiter for width computations.
.\" The .br manages to deal with this in this special case.
.TP
4)  @sub.domain
.br
The user must reside on any host within the domain specified.
Neither the user or the hostname needs to match; only the domain name must
be required to match.
.RE
.\" Nroff note: RE takes us all the way out of TP, so step back in again.
.RS
.sp
Example:
.sp
.nf
.ti +2
set autosign2 = \*Q!zipcode @sun.com @mit.edu *schaefer root: \--dan\*U
.fi
.sp
This means that any mail sent to 1) anyone at zipcode, 2) anyone within
the sun domain, 3) anyone within the mit domain, 4) Bart Schaefer
(at any host anywhere -- even locally),
and 4) root on the local machine only (or, root@local-machine-name)
is signed with the \*Qalternate\*U signature.
If any address on the
recipient list fails to satisfy these four matches, the mail is
signed by my regular signature.
.sp
One can have a local signature and a remote signature by specifying
the autosign2 to include the hostname of the home machine the user
is logged into.  Note the \*Qzipcode\*U example above.
.sp
The list of recipients, after alias expansion and comment removal, is
then scanned and the following patterns are matched against those addresses
specified in the autosign2 or fortunates variable according to these rules.
.sp
The signature description is the same as described by
.B autosign
variable.  The colon (:) separates the list of addresses from the signature
description.  If there is no colon or the address list is missing, the
entire string is considered the signature (except for the colon).
.sp
If
.B autosign
is not set, then autosign2 works ONLY if the tilde command \*Q~S\*U
is specified.  In this way, a user may never have autosign set and just
set autosign2 to be some signature value.  The user may then issue the
tilde command to automatically sign the letter.
If a list of addresses is given (terminated by a colon), then all
recipients of the message must be in the list of addresses in autosign2;
otherwise, the signature in \fBautosign\fR (if set) is used instead.
A null signature in autosign2 does not sign the letter.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.nf
.ti +2
set autosign2 = "fred, barney, wilma, betty: ~/flintstone.sig"
.fi
.sp
If a message is sent to:
.sp
.ti +2
To: fred, wilma
.sp
Then the file ~/flintstone.sig is used.
However, if the address are:
.sp
.ti +2
To: barney, betty, bambam
.sp
Then autosign2 is not used because bambam is not in the list.
.sp
Note that mail sent via redirection from the calling shell does not
sign letters or append fortunes.
.RE
.TP
.B cdpath
(String)
Set to a string of pathnames separated by spaces to use when searching
for a directory when the
.B cd
command is issued.
The current directory is always checked before any directory in 
.BR cdpath .
.TP
.B cmd_help
(String)
This variable gives the path name of the general help file, which is read
by the
.B help
command.
This variable is normally reset only in the system initialization files,
when the default location of the help file has changed.
.TP
.B complete
(String)
Setting this variable enables word completion.
The first character of the value of
.B complete
is used as the
.IR "completion character" ;
if
.B complete
is set, but not to a value, the escape character is used as the default.
When the completion character is typed at the end of a word prefix,
.I Mush
interactively completes that word.
If the prefix is not unique, the word is completed as far as possible
and a bell sounds (see, however, the variable
.BR quiet ).
If the word contains filename metacharacters,
.IR "all possible matches are completed" .
If the list overflows the command line buffer, it gets truncated, so
this feature should be used with care.
Metacharacters recognized are the same as in
.IR csh .
.sp
The second character of the value of
.B complete
is used as the completion listing character.
When this character is typed, the possible completions are printed, and
.I Mush
prompts again with the original prefix.
If
.B complete
is set to only a single character, completion listing is disabled;
if it is set with no value, control-D (^D) is used as the default
listing character.
.sp
If the first and second characters of
.B complete
are the same character, then
.I Mush
completes unique matches as usual
However, partial matches produce a listing
of the possible completions before completing as far as possible.
This can become rather verbose.
See the description of the variable
.B fignore
for ways to exclude filenames from completions.
.sp
Word completion is currently supported only for file names.
Command name and alias completion may be added in a future version.
Completion is not possible if the \-e (\-echo) flag was given.
Tool mode does not check the value of
.BR complete ,
but instead provides simple completion only, using the ESC key.
.TP
.B compose_icon
(Boolean/String)
Set to a pathname for an alternate icon pixmap to use when the
.I Mush
message composition window is closed.
If this variable is set but does not have a value, a default icon is used.
If this variable is not set, the composition window is hidden when it
is not open, and no icon appears.
The \*QCompose\*U button is used to re-open the window in this case.
.TP
.B crt
(Numeric)
Set to a value that describes the number of lines a message
must have before invoking the
.B pager
to view a message.
.TP
.B crt_win
(Numeric)
Set to the height (in lines) of the message display window in tool mode.
Resetting this variable after the program is running will not change
the height of the display, and may confuse other operations.
.TP
.B curses_help
(String)
This variable may be set to a space-separated list of curses mode command
names (see the CURSES section for the possible choices).
If set but without a value, a default list established by your
.I Mush
maintainer is used.
When it is set, a display of the current bindings for the listed commands
appears at the bottom of the screen in curses mode.
This help display normally shortens the display of headers, but the
user may explicitly scroll over the help display if he wishes to see
more headers.
.TP
.B cwd
(String)
The
.B "current working directory"
string is automatically set upon startup of
.I Mush
and is reset each time the commands
.B cd
and
.B pwd
are called.
It may be changed like any other shell variable, but this is not recommended.
.TP
.B date_received
(Boolean)
When message headers are printed, the date normally shown is
the time and date the sender sent the message.  If this variable
is set, then the date displayed is the date received.
.sp
When sorting messages by date, this variable is queried to determine
whether the messages should be sorted by date sent or date received.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fR For mailers that store messages \fIwithout\fR a line
that starts with \*QFrom \*U, this option does nothing.
.TP
.B dead\ \ 
(String)
File to use instead of dead.letter when interrupted mail is saved.
May be set to a \fIunix\fR command by prefixing the value with `|'.
For more information, see the variable
.B nosave.
.TP
.B domain_route
(Boolean/String)
In combination with
.BR auto_route ,
this variable specifies that addresses containing a fully-qualified domain
should be short-circuited to mail directly to the rightmost fully-qualified
domain.
If set boolean (not to a string), only short-circuiting is done.
If set to a string, the address is rewritten to UUCP form and the value
of the variable is prepended.
Domain short-circuiting applies \fIonly\fR to addresses containing a
fully-qualified domain, but short-circuits in spite of any path specified
with the \-r flag of
.B reply
or through the string value of
.B auto_route
(thus possibly omitting the auto_route or \-r paths altogether).
See
.B auto_route
for more information.
.TP
.B dot
(Boolean)
Causes
.I Mush
to accept a `.' on a line by itself,
in addition to `^D', to terminate messages.
.TP
.B editor
(String)
Specifies the editor to use when the \*Q~e\*U escape or the
.B edit
command is used.
Default is the value of the environment string EDITOR or the variable
.BR visual .
.TP
.B edit_hdrs
(Boolean)
When in letter-composition mode (via \fBmail\fR or \fBreply\fR, etc),
the headers of the outgoing message are stored in the same buffer as
the text of the letter.
So, if the editor is called to edit the message
buffer, the headers of the message can be edited as well.
However, there are some restrictions.
.sp
There must be a To: header.
Without this, 
.I Mush
does not deliver the letter.
Instead, the editor must be reentered and a To: header with
a valid recipient must be inserted.
A valid Cc: header does not remove this restriction.
You may have as many To: and Cc: headers as you like.
.sp
The From: header normally should not be changed.
If you change this header to an address that
.I Mush
is unable to identify as
authentic, the original From: header is silently put back.
.sp
The Date: header is always replaced by one with a more accurate
time and date stamp.
Therefore, changing or removing this header has no effect.
.sp
You cannot add a Status: header, and blank headers are dropped.
For example, if an empty Cc: header exists, the header does
not show up in the outgoing message.
Therefore, leaving empty headers has no effect.
.sp
Aliases specified on the command line are expanded and put into the
message buffer in their expanded form regardless of the value of
.B no_expand.
However, if the user changes the headers using the editor and specifies
aliases, those aliases are not expanded if
.B no_expand
is set.
Otherwise, they are expanded as usual.
.sp
The headers Bcc: and Fcc: are removed as expected.
.sp
One added side effect of
.B edit_hdrs
is that you can add an Fcc: header to specify a \*QFile Carbon Copy\*U.
This must be a pathname to a file or program.
For programs, the pathname must be preceded by a pipe character (|).
Note that \fIall\fR addresses on the Fcc: line that do not begin with `|'
are interpreted as file names; don't put other kinds of addresses there.
.sp
When using
.B edit_hdrs,
certain tilde escapes don't work.
Specifically, any tilde escape that allows you to add or set headers or to
empty the file are inactive.
These functions are to be done in the editor only.
.sp
Once a letter is being edited,
.B edit_hdrs
cannot be set or unset; the user must end the letter (either
by sending it or forcefully terminating it) first.
.sp
Header editing is required (and happens automatically) when using the
\*QCompose\*U tool mode item.
.TP
.B escape
(Character)
When composing a mail message (not in an editor), and the
.B escape
character is the first character on the line, the next character
is examined and a corresponding function associated with that
.I "escape command"
is executed.
See
.B "tilde escapes"
for more information.
.TP
.B fignore
(String)
This variable is tested when filename completion is used (see the variable
.B complete
for details).
The value of
.B fignore
may be a list of filename extensions (\*Q.c\*U, \*Q.o\*Q, etc.), a list
of filename patterns containing metacharacters (*?{}[]), or a mixture of
the two.
Each element in the list must be separated from the others by a space.
When a filename completion occurs, any filenames with the extensions
listed in
.BR fignore ,
or matching the patterns given there, are omitted from the completion.
.sp
For example,
.sp
.ti +4
set fignore = ".o .s [Mm]ake*"
.sp
causes any filename ending in \*Q.o\*U or \*Q.s\*U, and any filename
beginning with \*QMake\*U or \*Qmake\*U, to be excluded from completions.
.sp
If all files in the current directory match the extensions or patterns,
.B fignore
is disabled and completion occurs.
For this reason, it is usually not a good idea to include \*Q*\*U in the list.
.TP
.B folder
(String)
The folder variable is set to the path of a directory where folders are kept.
This path is used by various commands to expand the `+' metacharacter (see
the
.B folder
command for details).
\*Q~/Mail\*U is the default expansion of `+'.
.TP
.B fortune
(Boolean/string)
If fortune is set, a random fortune is appended to the end of
all outgoing mail using the
.IR UNIX (TM)
command
.B /usr/games/fortune
(may vary from system to system).
If fortune is set to something that starts with
a `\-', then it is interpreted as a flag to fortune (e.g., \*Q\-o\*U).
If
.B fortune
starts with a `/', then the program described by
the string is executed (thus not doing fortune at all, if you want).
By default,
.I "fortune \-s"
(short fortunes) is used.
.TP
.B fortunates
(String)
When fortunes are added to messages, sometimes it is desirable to
make sure that only a selected group of people get a fortune since
certain people may not understand the messages at the end of your
mail.  Therefore, you can set a list of addresses (either pure addresses
or aliases that are expanded to addresses) to be the only people who
receive fortunes if one is to be appended.  Therefore,
if the To: and Cc: lines contain only address listed in this string
variable, then a fortune is appended to the message.
If those lists contain names that are not on the fortunates
list, then no fortune is added.
This cannot be overridden; using the
tilde command \*Q~F\*U does not force a fortune to be added unless the
individuals on the recipient list are all included in the fortunates
list.  The list is made up of addresses or aliases separated by spaces or
commas.
.I "NOTE: fortune must be set in order for fortunates to work."
.TP
.B hangup
(Boolean)
If this variable is set,
.I Mush
updates your folder before exiting when it receives a SIGHUP signal.
This is useful if you frequently read mail when dialed in over a noisy phone
line that often drops carrier.
.sp

Certain errors are ignored during this update, because it is presumed to be
impossible to query the user for instructions.
Except in the event of a write error, the folder is forced to contain
exactly those messages that were not deleted at the time of the hangup.
In particular, this means that if an error occurs when loading new mail before
the update, the new mail is lost.
Write errors still cause both the working tempfile and as much of the
folder as possible to be preserved.
.TP
.B hdr_format
(String)
This variable controls the format of the headers displayed by the
.B headers
command and in the curses and tool modes.
The format style of this variable string is similar to printf in C.
When printing the information, the variable is evaluated and each
character in the string is echoed unless a `%' character is
encountered.
If one is found, the following string substitutions are made:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
.ta 0.5i
%a	address of the author
%c	number of characters (bytes) in the message
%f	entire \*QFrom:\*U field (author)
%l	number of lines in the message
%i	the message-id (may not be present)
%n	name of the author
%s	subject of the message
%t	\*QTo:\*U field (recipients)
%u	user name (login) of the author
%d	date and time of the message
%T	time only of the message
%N	day number of the month of the message
%W	day of the week (Sun, Mon, etc.)
%M	month name of the message
%Y	year of the message
%y	last two digits of %Y
%Z	time zone of the message
\\n	a newline
\\t	a tab
.fi
.in -2
.sp
A field width specifier may be used in all options.
Thus, \*Q%20f\*U prints the first 20 characters of the from line.
No matter what the formatting string, the message number is printed,
possibly preceded by a `>' (for current message).
.sp
The \*Qaddress\*U and \*Qname\*U of the author
are extracted from the \*QFrom:\*U field of the message.
The name may be given in parentheses and
the rest of the line is the address, or the address is given in angle
brackets (`<' and `>') and the rest of the line is the name.
Sometimes the address is the only thing on the line,
in which case the name and address are the same.
.sp
A special format is also provided to obtain the contents of any header
not listed above.
If a format of the form \*Q%?header-name?\*U (both leading and following `?'
characters are required) appears in the value of 
.BR hdr_format ,
the named header is looked up.
For example,
.sp
.ti +4
set hdr_format = "%a %n %?phone?"
.sp
causes the electronic address, name, and (if a \*QPhone:\*U header is present)
phone number of the sender to be displayed.
.TP
.B history
(Numeric)
This variable is set to the number of commands the shell interface
remembers.  It is just like the history variable used in
.I csh.
If unset, the last command can always be referenced, but none other.
.TP
.B hold\ \ 
(Boolean)
Normally, when updating the system folder, read messages are saved in
your mbox (except those marked as preserved).
Setting
.B hold
prevents this from happening, and messages remain in the sytem folder
(usually /usr/spool/mail/username or /usr/mail/username).
This does not apply to folders other than the system folder, obviously.
.TP
.B home\ \ 
(String)
This variable describes the user's home directory.
The variable is initialized to the value of the environment variable HOME,
but can be modified at any time during the
.I Mush
session.
The home directory is the same directory where temporary
files are kept for editing and so forth.
If the home directory cannot be found or read/write access is denied, an
alternate directory, typically /tmp, is used.
.TP
.B hostname
(String)
This is the name of your computer.
It is used to compose a correct \*QFrom:\*U line for use with Mail Transport
Agents that do not create this header automatically.
This aids the recipients of your mail in replying to your messages.
The hostname is also used in auto-routing.
.sp
Note: the user should not have to set
this variable since it should be set automatically by the system.  However,
it may happen that the system's hostname cannot be queried and the user may
have to set this variable manually.
.TP
.B ignore_bang
(Boolean)
If set,
.I Mush
ignores the `!' character as a history reference.
Note that this severely limits use of the
.B cmd
facility, which depends upon history references for argument substitutions.
.TP
.B ignoreeof
(Boolean/string)
If set, `^D' does not cause an exit from
.IR Mush .
If set to a string, that string is executed as a command
when `^D' is typed.
This does not effect termination of messages under the
.B mail
and
.B reply
commands.
.TP
.B indent_str
(String)
When including messages into the text of a letter you are editing,
each line of the messages is preceded by the value of
.BR indent_str .
The value may contain formatting characters as described for
.BR hdr_format ,
which are expanded from the headers of the message that is being indented.
If it is unset, the message body is indented by the string \*Q> \*U.
See also the variables
.B pre_indent_str
and
.BR post_indent_str .
.TP
.B in_reply_to
(String)
This variable may be set to a string that completes the
header \*QIn-Reply-To:\*U.
The format of this string is identical to the options for the variable
.BR hdr_format .
.sp
For example, if the user responds to a message
from Dan Heller that was sent on October 21, 1987, at 10:39pm, with
.B in_reply_to
set to the string
.nf
.in +2
.sp
%n's message as of %d.
.sp
.ti -2
the header line
.sp
In-Reply-To: Dan Heller's message as of Oct 21, 1987, 10:39pm.
.in-2
.fi
.sp
is added to the message.
.TP
.B keepsave
(Boolean)
If set, the commands
.B save
and
.B write
do
.I not
mark messages for deletion.
.TP
.B known_hosts
(String)
Used in conjunction with the variable
.BR auto_route ,
this variable is set to a list of hosts, separated by spaces, tabs,
and/or commas, and describes
the hosts with whom you know your machine shares UUCP connections.
When replying to mail, the return path constructed will often have hostnames
that your site could contact directly, but instead
the mail is routed through a number of different machines first.
.sp
For example, if you respond to mail that contains the path
.sp
.ti +2
unicom!pixar!root
.sp
but your know your machine already calls pixar, then sending the mail
to unicom first is unnecessary.
If you have set your known_hosts string to include pixar in its list,
the resulting address looks like
.sp
.ti +2
pixar!root
.sp
Also see the command
.B replyall
for more information on constructing correct return addresses.
.TP
.B logfile
(String)
Set to a filename which logs the headers of outgoing messages.  The message
body of the message is not logged, unlike the copy stored in the
.B record
filename.
The logfile can be read as a folder to scan for the fact that
messages have been sent.
If \fBlogfile\fR and \fBrecord\fR are both set,
then the logfile and the record files match closely.
In this case, the record file can be quickly scanned by scanning the log
file instead.
.sp
If set, but not to a string, the log file defaults to ~/mail.log.
.TP
.B mail_icon
(String)
Set to a pathname for an alternate icon pixmap to use when the
.I Mush
tool is closed.
The number of messages in the mailbox is displayed as an icon label unless
the string
.I iconlabel
appears as one of the values of the variable
.BR quiet .
See also the variable
.B newmail_icon
for the icon displayed when new mail arrives or is present.
.TP
.B mbox\ \ 
(String)
Set to the pathname of a file
.I Mush
should use as the default folder for read mail.
When
.B mbox
is not set, \*Q~/mbox\*U is used.
.TP
.B metamail
(String)
This variable should be set to the name of a program that displays
multimedia messages encapsulated in MIME format
.RI ( e.g. ,
Nathaniel Borenstein's
.I metamail
program).
When this variable is set, any message that contains a Content-Type: header
will be passed to the indicated program for display (by any of the commands
.BR print ,
.BR type ,
.BR next ,
.IR etc. ).
This overrides truncation by the
.B top
command, disregards the value of
.BR crt ,
and forces all headers to be passed to the display program.
.IR NOTE :
If
.B alwaysignore
is boolean true (set but with no value), ignored headers are omitted and
blank lines are stripped as specified by the value of
.BR squeeze ,
.IR "even when sending to the metamail pager" .
If you set
.BR metamail ,
you should either not set
.B alwaysignore
or set it to one or more of its possible values.
.sp
The program specified by
.B metamail
is invoked in tool mode as well, instead of paging the message in the
message subwindow.
This program is therefore expected to be able to determine for itself
.RI ( e.g. ,
via the
.I mailcap
configuration file) that SunView is running, and to
create appropriate windows as needed.
.TP
.B metoo
(Boolean)
When replying to mail, you are normally deleted from the list of
recipients.
If metoo is set, you remain on the list.
See the 
.B alternates
command for information on how
.I Mush
determines whether you are on the list.
.TP
.B mil_time
(Boolean)
Whenever the time is displayed in a message header or in the prompt,
it can be displayed in either 12-hour am/pm format, or in 24 hour
military time format.
The default is the 12 hour format, but can be
reset to use the 24 hour format by setting this variable.
.TP
.B msg_win
(Numeric)
Set to the height (in lines) of the message composition (editing) window in
tool mode.
.TP
.B newline
(Boolean/string)
When set, an empty command (carriage return with no text) typed at the
line-mode prompt is ignored.
If set to a string, that string is executed as a command when a
carriage return is typed.
Otherwise, carriage return acts as an implicit
.B next
command, and prints the next undeleted message.
.TP
.B newmail_icon
(String)
Set to a pathname for an alternate icon pixmap to use
when new mail is available.
.TP
.B no_expand
(Boolean)
When a
.I Mush
alias is used to reference a list of addresses, the list is expanded on
the To: and Cc: lines to indicate the complete list of all the recipients of
the message.
When no_expand is set, aliases are not expanded and the headers
reflect the same information as typed by the user.
.TP
.B no_hdrs
(Boolean)
If set, this variable tells 
.I Mush
not to include your personalized mail headers in messages.
This does not unset your headers, it just disables them.
.TP
.B no_reverse
(Boolean)
In curses mode and in the tool mode, reverse video is not used to indicate the 
.I "current message"
if this variable is set.
In the tool mode, if reverse video is not in use,
text is displayed in \*Qbold\*U.
.TP
.B nonobang
(Boolean)
If this variable is set, history references that don't match anything
are left unexpanded, rather than generating error messages.
This is useful if you want argument referencing in
.B cmd
expansions, but do
not want to remember to escape every `!' you type in UUCP addresses.
It is also recommended for use with curses mode, because history is not
kept for line mode escapes from that interface.
.TP
.B nosave
(Boolean)
When composing a letter, the user can terminate the letter without sending
it by using the tilde escape \*Q~q\*U or by sending two \*Qinterrupt\*U
signals.
When the message is terminated, a copy of it is saved to the
file \*Qdead.letter\*U in the user's home directory or to the file described
by the variable
.BR dead .
If the variable
.B nosave
is set, then a backup copy of the message is not saved.
.TP
.B output
(Read-only string)
This variable holds a message list representing the output of the last
successful command.
This is useful for recovering from broken pipes or to capture the output
of a command without affecting the information it displays (some commands
limit or suppress output when used in a pipeline).
Commands which return an error status (see the variable
.BR status )
do not affect the value of
.BR output ,
but successful commands that return no message list clear it.
Also, many curses mode commands return an error status to indicate that
the display has been altered, even if no actual error occurred.
This variable is thus most useful in line mode and in scripts.
.TP
.B pager
(String)
If a message is longer than the number of lines that the variable
.B crt
is set to, then this program is executed to view a message.
If the user does not have this variable set, the user's environment PAGER
is checked.
If this isn't set, then the default value for pager (set up
by the system manager) is used.
This may or may not be the internal pager.
To use the internal pager, you may set the variable pager
to \*Q\fIinternal\fR\*U or to a null string.
.TP
.B pre_indent_str
(String)
If this variable is set, when including the body of a message into an outgoing
mail message (using the \-i option to
.I reply
or
.IR mail ,
or when using the \*Q~i\*U escape),
a line preceding the first line of
included text is printed using the string value of the variable.
This string uses the same printf style formatting characters as the
.B hdr_format
variable.
For example, you could set
.B pre_indent_str
as follows:
.sp
.ti +2
set pre_indent_str = '[In the message entitled "%s", on %7d\\n %n writes:]'
.sp
You can then include a message body using \*Q~i\*U, and you might
get something like this:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
[In the message entitled "This is a test.", on Jan 19,
 Dan Heller writes:]
> This is a test message to show how
> pre_indent_str might be used.
.ti -2
.sp
.fi
This example assumes that the string value of
.B indent_str
is not set.
.TP
.B post_indent_str
(String)
This variable has the same function as
.B pre_indent_str
except that the string is inserted into the message body
.I after
the text of the included message rather than before.
The purpose of this variable is to complement the string described by
the variables
.B pre_indent_str
and
.BR indent_str .
For example,
.sp
.in +2
.nf
set pre_indent_str = "/*"
set indent_str = " * "
set post_indent_str = " */"
.sp
.ti -2
An included message might look something like this:
.sp
/*
 * This is a test message to show how
 * post_indent_str and pre_indent_str
 * can work together with indent_str.
 */
.fi
.in -2
.TP
.B printer
(String)
Used to set the default printer for the lpr command.
.TP
.B print_cmd
(String)
This string should describe a
.IR UNIX (TM)
command other than "lpr" for sending
messages to the line printer.
Some people may choose to use a device independent
troff style program, but virtually any UNIX command suffices.
Common usage might include:
.sp
.ti +2
set print_cmd = 'ptroff \-ms \-Plp'
.ti +2
lpr .\-$
.sp
This command sends all messages from the current message to the last
message through the ptroff command, supplying the appropriate arguments.
.TP
.B prompt
(String)
You can set your prompt to tell you many different pieces of information.
By default, the prompt is set to the string
.sp
.ti +2
\*QMsg %m of %t: \*U
.sp
If you have 10 messages and your current message is 5, then your prompt
looks like:
.sp
.ti +2
Msg 5 of 10:
.sp
The string value that prompt is set to is printed as your prompt.
If the string contains a `%', then that character is
ignored, the next character is evaluated and an appropriate
value is printed in its place:
.sp
.nf
.in +2
.ta 0.5i
%F	full path name of the current folder
%f	name of the current folder (tail of %F)
%m	\*Qcurrent message\*U number
%t	total number of messages
%n	number of \*Qnew\*U messages
%u	number of unread messages
%d	number of deleted messages
%T	current time (hours and seconds)
%N	today's date (Number of the day in the month)
%W	weekday name (Sun, Mon, Tue, ...)
%M	current month
%Y	this year
%y	last two digits of %Y
\\n	a newline
\\t	a tab
.fi
.in -2
.sp
To include the values of variables in the prompt string, the format
\*Q%$variable\*U can be used, where
.I variable
is the name of any variable.
If the `$' character is
.I not
preceded by a `%', it is included literally,
rather than introducing a variable name.
Thus, two equivalent ways of including the name of the current folder
in your prompt are:
.nf
.in +4
set prompt = '%F> '
set prompt = '%$thisfolder> '
.in -4
.fi
.sp
Note the use of single quotes to prevent the value of
.B thisfolder
from being expanded at the time the prompt is set.
The only difference between these settings is that \*Q%F\*U adds the
string \*Q[read-only]\*U if the folder was loaded in read-only mode.
.TP
.B quiet
(Boolean/Multivalued)
This variable tells
.I Mush
to be quiet in various circumstances.
If set, but not to any values, the currently running version of
.I Mush
is not printed on startup.
Otherwise,
.B quiet
may be set to one or more words separated by spaces or commas.
Currently recognized words are:
.sp
.nf
.ta 1.5i
.in +4
.\" \& escapes are to make obvious the tab after each word
autosign	Suppress messages when appending signature.
await\&\&	Suppress \fBawait\fR's bell for new mail.
complete	Suppress word completion error bells.
fkey\&\&	Suppress warnings about unset function keys.
fortune\&	Suppress messages when appending fortune.
iconlabel	Suppress showing message count as icon label.
newmail\&	Suppress new mail notification messages.
pick\&\&	Suppress descriptions of pick searches.
startup\&	Suppress the startup message.
tool\&\&	Suppress tool mode bell for new mail.
.in -4
.fi
.sp
Error conditions for signatures and fortunes are still reported.
See the variables
.BR autosign ,
.BR complete ,
and
.B fortune
for more details.
The
.I newmail
setting does not prevent automatic inclusion of new mail, it only
suppresses the announcement of its arrival, including tool mode bells.
The
.I fkey
setting applies only to tool mode.
.TP
.B realname
(String)
Set to the name of the user.
The name is initialized to the value of the environment variable
.B NAME
upon invocation of the program.
If that isn't set, then the name is obtained from the password file if
available.
If this variable wants to be reset or changed after the
program has started, the user should issue the command:
.sp
.ti +2
set realname = "Your name here"
.TP
.B record
(String)
Set to the name of a file to record all outgoing mail.
This should be a full pathname or the current directory is searched.
The pathname may begin with `+' (indicating the user's ~/Mail directory
or the value of the 
.B folder
variable) or with a `~' (or \*Q~user\*U)
indicating the user's home directory.
.TP
.B reply_to_hdr
(String)
When replying to mail,
.I Mush
searches for return paths from the message by searching for
the message headings \*QReply-to\*U, \*QFrom:\*U, and \*QReturn-path\*U,
in that order.
If none are found, then the first line of the
message created by the delivery system is parsed and the address
given there is used.  This special message header is created by most
mail delivery programs, but not all of them (MMDF, for one).  This line
is called the
.B From_
header because it is a colon-less header, but contains the return address
of the author of the message.
If the variable
.B reply_to_hdr
is set to a list of headers (delimited by spaces or commas), then that list
is searched.  If none of the headers listed in the variable exist
in the message, then a warning message is printed and the default
headers are used.  The special case From_ header can be specified
as one of the headers to search for.
.sp
.nf
.ti +2
set reply_to_hdr = "sender reply-to return-path from_"
.fi
.sp
This example shows that 
.I Mush
searches (in order) the headers listed in the reply_to_hdr variable.
If one header isn't found, then
.I Mush
looks for the next in the list.
If none of the headers in the list are found, the default headers (mentioned
above) are searched.
The last header listed in the example is the special \*QFrom \*U header.
Also see the
.B reply
command.
.TP
.B save_empty
(Boolean)
Normally, when all messages in a folder are deleted and the user updates
the folder or changes to a new folder, the empty folder is deleted.
.B save_empty
prevents the folder from being deleted and it is left zero length.
Note: the main system mailbox is never deleted, even when empty.
.TP
.B screen
(Numeric)
May be set to the number of message headers to display at a time in the
line and curses modes.
.TP
.B screen_win
(Numeric)
May be set to the number of message headers to display in the tool mode.
A subwindow is created for message headers, and its size is large
enough to hold $screen_win headers.
Resetting this variable after the program is running will not change
the height of the display, and may confuse other operations.
.TP
.B sendmail
(String)
If set, the program and arguments described by this variable
are executed to actually deliver mail sent by
.I Mush.
.TP
.B show_deleted
(Boolean)
If true, deleted message headers are displayed along with
other messages (`*' indicates a deleted message) for the \fBheaders\fR
command.  Also, deleted messages can be displayed using any command which
displays a message.
In curses mode, this variable is ignored and deleted messages are always
displayed with other messages to facilitate undeleting messages.
.TP
.B show_hdrs
(Multivalued)
Set to a list (space and/or comma separated) of headers that are to be the
only headers displayed when viewing a message.
This variable disables the headers suppressed by the
.B ignore
command.
For example,
.sp
.ti +2
set show_hdrs = \*Qfrom date subject to cc\*U
.sp
only displays the headers
.B From: Date: Subject: To: Cc:
in their entirety.
.TP
.B sort\ \ 
(Boolean/string)
The value of this variable is the same as the arguments to the
.B sort
command.
This variable is used for the initialization file to presort
mail in the system mailbox upon entering
.IR Mush .
See the COMMANDS section for more information.
.TP
.B squeeze
(Boolean)
Whenever messages are read, piped, or saved, if this variable is set,
all consecutive blank lines are squeezed into one blank line.
.TP
.B status
(Read-only numeric)
This variable records the success or failure status of the most recently
executed command.
All line-mode commands return 0 (zero) for success and a negative value for
error.
Some curses mode commands return an error status to indicate that the
display has been corrupted, even when no actual error has occurred.
This variable is most useful in scripts to test the success of an operation
before proceeding.
.TP
.B tmpdir
(String)
This variable describes the path to use as the directory
for all tempfiles that
.I Mush
uses.  By default, the user's home directory is used.  If that
cannot be accessed, a directory writable by all is used (typically, /tmp).
If \fBtmpdir\fR is set, then it is used first.
.TP
.B thisfolder
(Read-only string)
The full path name of the current mailbox.
This variable cannot be modified or displayed by the
.B set
command; its value changes whenever a new folder is entered with the
.B folder
command.
During sourcing of the initialization files,
.B thisfolder
is not set, because the current folder has not yet been read.
If you refer to \*Q$thisfolder\*U in an initialization file
.RI ( e.g. ,
.IR .mushrc ),
be sure to do so inside an \*Qif $?thisfolder\*U test.
.TP
.B toplines
(Numeric)
The number of lines of a message to print when the
.B top
command is issued.  If unset, the value of
.B crt
determines the number of lines printed.
Note that the message body only is printed when using the
.B top
command; message headers are not counted as lines since they are not displayed.
.TP
.B unix\ \ 
(Boolean)
If set, commands that are not
.I Mush
commands are considered to be
.IR UNIX (TM)
commands.
This removes the inconvenience of requiring the user to do
shell escapes to do quick
.I UNIX
commands.
For systems that support job control, SIGTSTP stops the entire
.I Mush
shell as well as the process being executed.
When SIGCONT is delivered, both receive the
signal and
.I Mush
continues to wait for the job to finish.
.sp
Due to the lack of real job control, input/output redirection and UNIX command
piping, this mode of
.I Mush
is not intended to be used as a login shell.
.sp
If a
.I Mush
command name conflicts with a
.I UNIX
command, use the command
.B sh
to force execution as a shell command or use the full pathname of the command
(e.g. starting with a '/').
.sp
.BR Warning :
.I "Be aware that Mush pipes transmit message lists, NOT TEXT."
You cannot pipe the output of
.I UNIX
commands to or from
.I Mush
commands or other
.I UNIX
commands with the
.I Mush
pipe mechanism.  You can, however, pipe
.I Mush
commands to a final UNIX
command (see the \fBpipe\fR command for more information).
UNIX commands should be simple commands without pipes or metacharacters.
.sp
This feature is not available for the tool mode.
.TP
.B verbose
(Boolean)
Passes verbose flag to mail delivery systems when sending mail, and
causes
.I Mush
to print additional information about the sending process.
.TP
.B verify
(Boolean/Multivalued)
This variable causes mush to request confirmation of certain actions.
If set only as a boolean (no string value), 
.B verify
asks just before sending mail whether you want to send, continue
editing, or abort the message altogether.
Otherwise,
.B verify
can be set to one or more of these words:
.sp
.nf
.ta 1.25i
.in +4
.\" \& escapes are to make obvious the tab after each word
mail\&\&	Confirm sending of mail (as above).
save\&\&	Confirm save-item selections (tool only).
.in -4
.fi
.sp
Appending of messages to files that are not folders is verified regardless
of the setting of this variable.
.TP
.B version
(Read-only String)
The value of this variable is the version string, printed by
.I Mush
at startup (unless
.B quiet
is set) and included in the \*QX-Mailer:\*U header in messages.
.TP
.B visual
(String)
May be set to the visual editor to use when ~v is specified.
Default is vi or the environment string VISUAL.
The visual editor is invoked by the \-e arguments to the
commands, 
.B respond
and
.BR mail .
.TP
.B warning
(Boolean)
If set, warning messages are printed when:
.in +4
.ti -2
\(bu A command line alias (\*Qcmd\*U) looks like a command.
.br
For example,
.ti +2
cmd mail 'set fortune; \\mail'
.ti +2
cmd respond 'unset fortune; \\respond;'
.ti -2
\(bu The date format of a message is unknown.
.br
The date of a message is taken from the \*QDate:\*U header.
If the date on that header is unknown, other headers are searched for a
valid date format until a legal one is found.
This date may not be
correct in that it was the date the message was received, not sent.
.ti -2
\(bu A variable is unset without first being set.
.br
For example, if you give the command
.ti +2
unset metoo
and the variable
.B metoo
is not set, you are notified that the variable is not defined.
.ti -2
\(bu No header can be found for a digest article.
.br
This occurs when the
.B undigest
command encounters what appears to be an article separator but cannot
find a \*QFrom:\*U or \*QDate:\*U header in the following text.
.in -4
.sp
The intent is so that users who are used to their own environments
become aware of changes in other environments should they be forced
to use them.
There may also be warning messages of failed routines
or assertions that are not fatal enough to interrupt normal running
of the program.
.TP
.B wrap\ \ 
(Boolean)
Normally, when the last message is deleted, the current message
pointer remains pointing to the last message and the user is done
reviewing his mail.
If the
.B wrap
variable is set, the current message pointer wraps around to the
beginning of the user's messages again to the next undeleted message.
This also applies to the
.B next
command.
.TP
.B wrapcolumn
(Numeric)
May be set to a column number at which line wrap occurs when
composing messages.
If set, but given no value, column 78 is assumed.
When
.I Mush
is able to determine the number of columns on your screen, it
enforces a maximum value for
.B wrapcolumn
of two less than that number of columns.
Line wrapping can be disabled either by unsetting
.B wrapcolumn
or by setting it with the explicit value of 0 (zero).
.sp
Line wrapping occurs only at whitespace (spaces or tabs).
Lines containing no whitespace to the left of the specified column
are not wrapped.
If \fIMush\fR was started with the \-e (echo mode) option, or is in tool mode,
line wrapping cannot be done due to I/O incompatibilities.
.PP
In addition to the named variables described above, three special
variable forms are recognized.
.TP
.B $$
This string returns the process id (PID) of the current
.I mush
process.
Colon modifiers are not recognized for this special variable.
.TP
.BI $[ %fmt ]
The string \fI%fmt\fR is interpreted as a header formatting string
(as in the
.B hdr_format
variable) and is expanded using the headers from the current message.
Colon modifiers are allowed to follow the format.
For example,
.sp
.ti +4
save $[%4n]:l
.sp
saves the current message in a file whose name is the first four
characters of the name of the author, converted to lower case.
.TP
.BI $( %c )
The string `\fI%c\fR' is interpreted as a prompt format
(as in the
.B prompt
variable) and is expanded.
Colon modifiers are allowed.
For example,
.sp
.ti +4
echo $(%T)
.sp
prints the current time.
Note that \*Q$(%F)\*U is equivalent to \*Q$thisfolder\*U.
.PP
NOTE:  Evaluation of many \*Q$[%...]\*U or \*Q$(%...)\*U values in a single
command is inefficient.
If expansion of several formats is desired, it is better to use the \-h
and \-p options of
.B echo
or
.BR eval ,
which also provide better quoting of the interpolated strings.
.SH "MUSH SCRIPTS"
One of the most useful features of
.I Mush
is the ability to write scripts of
commands, which can be read by the
.B source
command from within
.IR Mush ,
or by redirecting input from the script and using the \-i option.
If your operating system supports the \*Q#!\*U interpreter mechanism,
a script can be even be executed as a program.
Script files can use all the usual
.I Mush
commands; the only restriction is
that the `!' history notation for referencing arguments of
.B cmd
aliases is disabled in scripts, so only very simple
.BR cmd s
work.
.PP
For example, a filtering file, \*Qfilter\*U, might contain:
.sp
.nf
.in +2
set newfolder = /usr/spool/mail/$USER
if is_shell
.in +4
if -z $newfolder
.ti +4
set newfolder = $mbox	# mbox must be set!
endif
if -e $newfolder
.ti +4
folder $newfolder
else
.ti +4
quit
endif
.in -4
endif
.sp
pick -f Mailer-Daemon | save mail_errors
pick -f yukko | delete
pick -s -i thesis | save +thesis_mail
pick -t unix-wizards | +wizmail
update
sort d
.in -2
.fi
.sp
Then the first command the user types when beginning a
.I Mush
session might be \*Qsource filter\*U, and the following happens:
.sp
.in +2
First, a new variable called \fBnewfolder\fR is set to the user's spool
mailbox (the system mailbox).
A test is made to see if the shell is running, because the \fBfolder\fR
command can only be used from the shell.
Then a test is done to see if the spool mailbox is zero length, and if it is,
the variable is reset to the value of the user's \fBmbox\fR variable
(mbox must already be set by this time or this fails).
A final test assures that the new folder exists.
If it does, \fIMush\fR changes folders to the new folder.
If it doesn't exist, the program exits (via \fBquit\fR).
.sp
Once the correct folder has been loaded, all messages that have
\*QMailer-Daemon\*U in the From header are saved in the file mail_errors.
Then, all mail from the user \*Qyukko\*U is simply deleted.
Next, all mail that has in the Subject field, \*Qthesis\*U
(case ignored, so \*QThesis\*U would also match) are
saved in the file $folder/thesis.
The next command finds all messages that are addressed to
the group \*Qunix-wizards\*U (of which the user is an elite
member) and saves them in the file $folder/wizmail.
Last, the folder is updated, removing all deleted mail
(saved mail may be marked as deleted)
and the folder is reread and sorted according to the date of the messages.
.in -2
.PP
If the \*Q#!\*U mechanism is supported, the \*Qfilter\*U script can be
made into a program by adding as the first line:
.sp
.ti +4
#! /usr/local/bin/mush -F
.sp
(The actual location of
.I mush
may vary from system to system; /usr/local/bin is used as an example.)  Then
make the file executable:
.sp
.ti +4
chmod +x filter
.sp
Now, when the command \*Qfilter\*U is typed at the user's regular shell
prompt, the
.I mush 
program is invoked by the operating system.
.I Mush
first reads the commands from the \*Qfilter\*U file and performs them,
exactly as described above, and then continues into the usual interface.
If it is preferable for
.I mush
to exit after reading the script, the first line can be changed to:
.sp
.ti +4
#! /usr/local/bin/mush -F!
.sp
The \-F! option should also be used when running
scripts in the background or in other circumstances where the standard
input cannot be a terminal, and the only commands to be executed are those
in the script itself.
.PP
Note that any additional arguments passed to a \*Q#!\*U script are
interpreted by
.IR mush ;
they are not passed along in any way that makes them accessible to the script.
Thus,
.sp
.ti +4
% filter \-f mbox
.sp
applies the commands in the \*Qfilter\*U script to the \*Qmbox\*U folder.
.SH MACROS
Macros are available in several different modes in
.IR Mush .
.I "Curses mode macros"
are created by using the
.B bind
command with the special function
.B macro
(or by using
.BR bind-macro ,
which is synonymous).
These macros are effective only when the curses interface is active.
.I "Line mode macros"
are created with the
.B map
command, and are effective only in the line-oriented command interface.
Finally,
.I "composition mode macros"
are created with the
.B map!
command, and are effective only when composing mail messages.
Macros are not available in the
.I tool
mode, nor when composing messages from the tool mode.
Line and composition mode macros are also nonfunctional when
.I Mush
is started with the \-e (echo) option.
.PP
In general, macros consist of two parts:  a
.I "key sequence"
and an
.IR expansion .
The
.B "key sequence"
is the character or string of characters which, when typed in the
appropriate mode, is recognized by
.I Mush
as a reference to a macro.
The
.B expansion
part of a macro is the string that is actually \*Qseen\*U by
.I Mush
when the key sequence is recognized.
Macros are like an interactive search-and-replace function;
if a key sequence appears in the input, the associated expansion is
substituted in its place.
Thus, if you create a macro whose key sequence is \*Q^X^W\*U (control-X
control-W) and whose expansion is \*Qsave\*U, then when you hold down the
control key and type the two characters `x' and `w', the effect is
as if you had actually typed the four characters `s', `a', `v' and `e'.
This is called \*Qexpanding\*U the macro.
More detailed examples of macros are presented in the subsections
for each mode in which macros can be used.
.PP
Key sequences are usually made up of control characters or special
strings of characters generated by \*Qfunction keys,\*U
but may in fact be almost any string the user desires.
Keys that generate a signal or an end-of-file from the keyboard
(for example, on BSD systems, control-Z generates a TSTP signal and
control-D generates an end-of-file) can never appear
in key sequences, and macros in line or composition modes cannot
.I begin
with a newline, control-D, or any of the editing keys
(erase, word-erase, line-erase, etc.).
Otherwise, there are no restrictions.
It should be kept in mind, however, that for the line and composition
modes, key sequences should be unusual characters or combinations of
characters, not individual lower-case letters.
If common characters or strings are used for key sequences, much
confusion can result when typing commands or messages.
This is not important in the curses mode.
.PP
In the line and composition modes, a
.I timeout
is used for key recognition; that is, once the first character of the
key sequence has been typed, the succeeding characters must be typed
after it relatively quickly, or
.I Mush
fails to recognize them as a continuous sequence.
It is for this reason that key sequences are usually either very short,
or are strings that are automatically generated by pressing a special
key on the terminal.
On the other hand, the timeout can be used intentionally to prevent a
macro from being expanded; simply type the first character of the macro,
then wait for it to echo before typing the next.
This does not work in curses mode, because curses macros
never \*Qtime out.\*U
.PP
In any mode, macros are
.IR recursive ;
that is, if the
.I "key sequence"
of one macro appears in the
.I expansion
of another macro (or even of the same macro), the second key sequence
is recognized when the first macro is expanded, and this new key
sequence is also expanded.
Great care should be taken when creating macros to be certain that
recursive expansions do not happen unintentionally.
Expansion can be prevented in line or composition modes by using a
.I literal-next
character.
.PP
Literal-next characters may be used from the keyboard or embedded
in expansions.
In either case, they prevent the next character
from being interpreted as part of a key sequence.
.I Mush
recognizes the literal-next character from the tty settings of the
terminal, if the \*Qnew\*U BSD-style device driver is available;
otherwise, `^V' (control-V) is recognized as a literal-next.
Note that, if you have a tty literal-next character,
then when typing you need to type
.I two
of them in order to send one to \fIMush\fR; this is because the tty
driver consumes the first one.
It is not necessary to use two literal-nexts in macro expansions
unless you wish to cause the second literal-next to be literal.
.PP
Backslash can be used as a literal-next when typing, and can
sometimes be used as a literal-next in expansions; but use it
with caution, because it also introduces escape sequences
(see \*QMacro syntax,\*U below).
There is no literal-next mechanism for curses mode.
.PP
A macro always aborts whenever
.I any
command called by the macro returns an error.
This includes recursive expansions, so no matter how often a macro has
recurred, it is terminated completely.
Errors in curses mode include illegal cursor movements, such as up from
the top of the screen or down from the last message.
.PP
.BR "Macro syntax" .
.PP
A special syntax is provided for specifying control characters and other
non-printing characters in macro key sequences and expansions.
This syntax is the same as that for bindings, discussed in the
CURSES INTERFACE section; it can be summarized as:
.ta 1.25i
.in +2
.nf
\\CX	control-X (where X is any capital letter)
\\E	the escape character
\\n	a newline (other C-style escapes also work)
.fi
.in -2
.sp
Thus, to create a line mode macro for control-X control-W, as in the
example above, the command is
.sp
.ti +4
map '\\CX\\CW' save
.PP
Also provided is a syntax for executing functions from within macros.
There are two special functions that are effective in all modes;
these are
.I getstr
and
.IR getline .
Both of these functions interrupt expansion of the current macro,
and wait for a newline-terminated string to be entered from the
standard input.
This input string is inserted into the macro expansion.
The functions differ in that
.B getline
retains the newline character (carriage-return) at the end of the
input string, whereas
.B getstr
strips off the newline (one must still be typed to terminate input).
These functions can be executed by surrounding their name with
square brackets
.RB ( [ ,
.BR ] );
for example,
.sp
.ti +4
map '\\CX\\CW' save [getline]
.sp
creates a line mode macro, which is expanded when control-X control-W is
typed, and which displays \*Qsave\*U followed by a space and then waits
for the user to type a line of input; the input line is used as the
arguments to the save command.
.PP
Additional functions are currently available only in the curses mode.
However, the syntax of enclosing the function name in square brackets
applies to all functions, regardless of mode.
Note that
.I ONLY
the function name can appear in the brackets; no whitespace is allowed.
.PP
.BR "Curses mode macros" .
.PP
Macros in curses mode are the most versatile, because they can access the
full range of curses commands quickly and easily.
Every character that appears in the expansion part of a curses mode macro
can reference a curses command or another macro.
Like other curses functions, curses mode macros are created with the
.B bind
command.
For example, to sort your messages by date and then send the most recent
one to the printer, you could use
.sp
.ti +4
bind @ macro 'od$|'
.sp
When the `@' key is typed, this macro first invokes sort
(`o' from the default bindings) and instructs it to use date (d)
for sorting; it then moves the current-message pointer to the last
message ($) and prints that message (|).
.PP
Admittedly, the above macro is somewhat cryptic, and is dependent upon
the bindings for sort, last-msg, and lpr being set to the defaults.
It is better, and possibly more understandable, to refer to the
desired curses functions without using their key bindings.
To allow this, the \*Q[function]\*U syntax described above may be used
in curses mode macros to reference curses functions.
The only function that is prohibited from appearing in the \*Q[\|]\*U
is the special
.I macro
function, which cannot be called when it has no binding.
The example macro can therefore be rewritten as
.sp
.ti +4
bind @ macro [sort]d[last-msg][lpr]
.sp
Such references to curses functions may be made only in curses mode
macros, and are effective only when \fIMush\fR is actually in curses mode.
That may sound strange, but the most common use of curses macros is
to quickly perform functions that require an escape to the line mode.
For example, although there is a variation of the curses mode
.I mail
function that prompts for additional flags, there is no function
to prompt for flags to be passed to
.IR reply .
A macro can easily be created to provide this:
.sp
.ti +4
bind R macro '[line-mode]reply '
.sp
This macro binds `R' to perform an escape to line mode and type
the string \*Qreply\*U followed by a space.
Macro expansion then ends, leaving it up to the user to supply
flags to the command or to backspace over it if a different command
(or none) is desired.
Of course, the macro could also have provided some default arguments:
.sp
.ti +4
bind R macro '[line-mode]reply \-ei '
.PP
Note that, if the
.B getline
or
.B getstr
function is used in a line-mode escape, it is not possible to
erase the text that is typed before the
.IR get ;
that is, if the macro is
.sp
.ti +4
bind R macro '[line-mode]reply \-ei [getline]'
.sp
then the user is forced to use the \-ei flags.
.PP
.BR "Line mode macros" .
.PP
Line mode macros combine some of the convenience of single-keystroke
commands with the versatility of the line-oriented text interface.
As has been noted, the choice of characters for line mode key sequences
should be made carefully, so as not to interfere with normal typing.
Line mode macros are created with the
.B map
command; for example, suppose you frequently forward messages to a
friend named \*Qfred.\*U  You could create a macro to do this:
.sp
.ti +4
map '\\CF' 'mail \-f . fred\\n'
.sp
This macro causes the single keystroke `^F' (control-F) to forward
the current message to \*Qfred.\*U  Note the newline
character \*Q\\n\*U at the end of the expansion;
this causes the command to be executed immediately,
without you having to type a carriage-return.
.PP
The expansion part of a line mode macro echoes to the screen when
it is expanded, so you can see what the macro is doing.
You can therefore use parts of the expansion as a \*Qprompt.\*U  In
the above example, suppose you wished to enter a message list rather
than always forwarding the current message.
Change the macro to:
.sp
.ti +4
map '\\CF' 'mail \-f [getstr] fred\\n'
.sp
This version of the macro prints \*Qmail \-f\*U and a space, then waits
for a newline-terminated string from the standard input.
The newline is stripped, and the string is used as the message list
passed to the \*Qmail \-f\*U command.
The address \*Qfred\*U is also passed to
.BR mail ,
so the messages in the list are forwarded to fred.
.PP
If you want to be able to \*Qchange your mind\*U after starting a
line mode macro, you must leave the \*Q\\n\*U out of the expansion.
Without the newline, the macro is not executed immediately, so
you have a chance erase the line (or part of it) and type
something different.
Remember that the
.B getline
function keeps the newline in the string it gets, so if you don't
want a newline to appear, you must use
.BR getstr .
When using the
.I get
functions, you should also remember that you can
.I never
backspace past the \*Qbeginning\*U of a
.BR getline ,
and you can backspace past the beginning of a
.B getstr
only after the get has been completed.
.PP
When the
.B getstr
function is used in line mode macros,
.I Mush
reprints the current input line so you can see what the whole
thing looks like, but does not redisplay the line mode prompt
(see the entry for
.B prompt
in the VARIABLES section for information on what the
prompt looks like).
Don't let this worry you.
The input line is also reprinted when
.B getline
is used, but the newline in the input string usually results in a
new prompt being displayed.
.PP
.IR NOTE :
Line mode macros are not available when using the line-mode escape
function in curses mode.
It is necessary to escape all the way to line mode (that is, leave
curses mode by typing carriage-return at the `:' prompt) in order
to access line mode macros.
This is to prevent possible confusion when similar macros exist
in both line and curses modes.
.PP
.BR "Composition mode macros" .
.PP
Composition mode macros are very similar to line mode macros, and
provide a \*Qpower typing\*U function when composing messages.
For example, you might want to have the word \*Qpercent\*U inserted
into your message whenever you hit the `%' key:
.sp
.ti +4
map! % percent
.sp
Another use is to simulate the indentation features of editors.
For example, you might
.sp
.ti +4
map! '\\CT' '\ \ \ \ '
.sp
(where the expansion is four spaces, enclosed in single quotes).
This macro causes four spaces to be inserted into the message whenever
control-T is typed.
.PP
Composition mode macros can also be used to execute
.I tilde-escapes
(see the GENERAL USAGE section for a list of these).
For example, you could create a macro to invoke the editor:
.sp
.ti +4
map! '\\CE' '\\n~v\\n'
.sp
When control-E is typed, this macro prints a newline (to be sure that
the tilde-escape is the first thing on a line), then types \*Q~v\*U
followed by another newline, to start the editor.
Similar macros can be created for other tilde-escapes.
.PP
.BR "Mixed mode macros" .
.PP
It is not normally possible to mix macros among the different modes.
However, once expansion has begun, it is interrupted only by an error
or by the appearance of one of the special
.I get
functions.
It is therefore possible to have a macro expansion which causes
the mode to change before the expansion has completed.
In this case, recursive expansions apply to the new mode.
Suppose we are using a variation of the editor-starting macro shown
above for composition mode:
.sp
.ti +4
map! '\\CE' '\\n~v emacs\\n'
.sp
This macro causes the \*Qemacs\*U editor to be started when control-E
is typed in composition mode.
We can now create a line mode macro that makes use of this
composition mode macro:
.sp
.ti +4
map '#' 'reply \-i [getline]~t[getline]\\CE'
.sp
When the `#' key is pressed in line mode, this macro
prints \*Qreply \-i\*U and waits for a message list, then enters
composition mode (by executing the
.B reply
command).
In composition mode, it displays the To: line
(the \*Q~t\*U escape) and waits for other addresses to be added.
Finally, it recursively expands the control-E macro, to
start editing the message with emacs.
.PP
As can be seen from this example, the
.I Mush
macro facility is very powerful.
Be very careful not to accidentally expand recursive macros,
especially when using macros that change modes.
When testing new macros, it is a good idea to start
.I Mush
in
.I read-only
mode (the \-r command line flag) to be sure that messages are
not lost or altered.
.PP
.BR "Getting rid of macros" .
.PP
It is not necessary to delete a macro in order to redefine it.
New expansions for existing key sequences automatically replace
the old expansions.
If it is necessary to remove a macro completely, the commands
.BR unbind ,
.B unmap
and
.B unmap!
can be used to remove curses mode, line mode, and composition mode
macros, respectively.
Remember to use a backslash or other literal-next character to prevent
the expansion of line mode macros when using these commands, especially
.BR unmap .
.SH "MAIL ADDRESSES"
Whenever a command that requires a user address or set of addresses
is specified
.RB ( mail ,
.BR reply ,
.BR alias ,
.BR etc )
the addresses given must be separated by commas.
Most casual users specify addresses that contain no comments or whitespace.
The simplest addresses are just the login names of the users you wish to send
your message to:
.sp
.ti +2
\fBmail\fR fred barney wilma betty
.sp
In these cases,
.I Mush
can figure out that they are separate addresses and
insert commas between addresses automatically.
.sp
.ti +2
To: fred, barney, wilma, betty
.sp
Addresses may also contain `!', `@' and `%' characters which are used
to separate hostnames and the final user name from each other.
This is primarily used to mail to users on other machines.
UUCP addresses are specified as
.sp
.ti +2
host1!host2!user
.sp
where there may be as many hosts as necessary to route the message
to the recipient user.
Here, the user's account is on \*Qhost2\*U
and that machine is connected to \*Qhost1\*U.
.I Domain
addresses (also called Arpanet, Internet, RFC822, and \*Qfully qualified\*U
addresses) are specified as
.sp
.ti +2
user@host.domain
.ti +2
user%host2.domain@host1
.sp
where \*Qdomain\*U is a domain name such as \*Q.berkeley.edu\*U or \*Q.com\*U.
As in the first example, the user is on \*Qhost2\*U, but that machine talks
to \*Qhost1\*U.
It is beyond the scope of this document to discuss in detail the ramifications
of inter-network mailing.
More information can be obtained through your system manager.
.PP
.I Mush
understands addresses containing a comment field.
Comment fields do not affect the destination address of mail being sent.
These fields are purely for
human legibility and may be specified according to the following constraints: 
.sp
Anything within angle brackets is an address; whatever is outside of the
address is considered a comment:
.sp
.ti +2
Dan Heller <zipcode!argv@cad.berkeley.edu>
.ti +2
Dan Heller <argv@zipcode.com>
.sp
Anything that has parentheses is a comment; whatever is outside of the
parentheses is considered the address:
.sp
.ti +2
zipcode!argv (Dan Heller)
.ti +2
argv@zipcode.com (Dan Heller)
.sp
Double quotes (") are treated just like parentheses:
.sp
.ti +2
"Dan Heller" zipcode!argv
.ti +2
"Dan Heller" argv@zipcode.com
.sp
If the comment is to contain a comma, the first case above may not be used;
you must use either the parenthesis or double-quote cases.
.sp
.ti +2
fred@flintstone.bed.rock (Fred Flintstone, Cave Man)
.sp
If the comment contains unbalanced quotes, unpredictable results may occur
.RI ( Mush
won't deliver the mail).
.sp
Since the angle brackets have the highest precedence, quotes or parentheses
may be used in conjunction with one another.
.sp
.ti +2
Yabba Dabba Doo (Fred Flintstone) <fred>
.ti +2
Scoobie "Doobie" Doo <scooby@shaggys.mystery.machine>
.PP
Multiple addresses may appear on a line:
.sp
.in +2
argv@zipcode.com argv@garp.mit.edu dheller
.in -2
.sp
Because there is no indication of comments (parenthesis, angle bracket,
or quotes), it is assumed that these are separate addresses and
.I Mush
inserts commas between these addresses accordingly.
It is for this reason that the user is encouraged to explicitly insert
commas between all mail addresses and not depend on the automation of comma
insertion to correctly separate addresses from one another.
.PP
Mail aliases may contain addresses of the form described above.
.sp
.nf
.in +2
.ta 1.5i
alias george	George Jetson <george@spacely.space.sprockets>
alias jane	Jane Jetson <jane@sky-high.appts>
alias group	george, jane
.in -2
.fi
.sp
You can mail using the alias as an address and it is expanded
accordingly.
You cannot, however, reference an alias and specify a
comment or another address at the same time.
.sp
.ti +2
To: The Jetsons <group>
.sp
The comment \*QThe Jetsons\*U is not retained when the alias \*Qgroup\*U
is expanded, because the entire address and comment are replaced by the
expansion.

.PP
Temporary files that are created by the program, and folders written with
.B save
and related commands, are always
created with read/write access to the owner only; group and other
permissions are never set.
This is also true for the /usr/spool/mail/* files.
All other files created by the user via commands internal or external
to the program have permissions set by the user's default umask.
If the umask is reset within the program, the mask remains
intact even after exiting.
Remember to set the variable
.B unix
before attempting to set the umask value.
.PP
If your system is using Sun Microsystem's NFS, take special note to
read the manual page for mount(1).
Filesystems mounted for read/write
access should be mounted as \*Qhard\*U NFS mounts or you may lose
mailboxes during a timeout during a write or update.
.PP
Filesystems that use RFS still have bugs to be ironed out in the way
of owners and permissions concerning utime(2).

.SH AUTHOR
The original
.I Mush
was written entirely by Dan Heller.
Code to support macros, line wrapping, and a whole lot of other miscellaneous
details, was written by Bart Schaefer, who gets his name in print
because he updated and proofread this manual.
Numerous others have supplied valuable suggestions
and assorted bits and pieces.

.SH DISCLAIMERS
.I Mush
contains no
.IR UNIX (TM)
sources and never has.
It is also not a modified version of any other mail user agent.
Similarities
with any other mailer may have been designed for compatibility reasons.

.SH BUGS
The curses interface uses the curses library.
The routines from the library that are used are the most basic and simple
so as to avoid possible bugginess that
different versions of UNIX might have.
However, one unavoidable problem is the reverse video mode.
Depending on your terminal,
the termcap entry for it, and the version of curses you are running,
the reverse video may make things worse than desired.
In such situations, the user should set the variable
.B no_reverse
to not get reverse video.
\&`^R' may still be entered at runtime in the curses
interface to toggle reverse video.
.PP
Toggling from the curses mode to the line mode to get the full
functionality of the shell/line mode is unfortunately necessary
in order to maintain the display in a sensible manner and to keep the
keystroke-command interface simple and \*Quser friendly\*U.
Mostly, such escapes are only necessary
for piping of commands and using the pick command.
Macros are a big help with this.
.PP
If the program is already running and the system [later] has to swap
and there is no swap space left, there may be problems.
One such problem is sending mail.
If this happens, then sending mail
fails and a segmentation fault from the spawned/forked child may occur
(unless the -v flag was given to mail).
The unsent letter is not removed from the editing file ($home/.edXXXXXX)
and may be recovered.
.PP
Many functions available to the line oriented mode (shell mode)
are not available to the tool mode.
For example,
.B pick
may not be directly accessed although experienced users may find that
typing pick commands within single backquotes in the \*QRange:\*U panel item
above the header window and then selecting a command that uses the range
does indeed pick messages.
This is mostly for selecting the \*Qdelete range\*U item
or the middle mouse button icon in the header panel.
.PP
Version 6.5.6 was the last version designed to run under SunWindows, and is
therefore the most recent version that functioned under SunOS 2.x.
Starting with versions 7.x, the interface used is SunView, and may have
a completely new set of problems in addition to those described below.
Also, some of those described below may have been eliminated, and remain
in this discussion only for completeness.
.PP
Shell escapes (of any kind) may be called only from the \*Qpipe\*U command
in the tool mode, should not be interactive, and should produce
output only to a file.
The reason for this is that there is no tty
.I window
in which to do input/output.
Since the interactive function-key binding interface has gone away, it is
unfortunately only possible to execute commands that have been pre-defined
in the initialization file.
Future revisions may correct these deficiencies.
.PP
The function keys and their ability to
.I work
has been variable depending on the version of SunWindows/SunView
your Sun Workstation has.  From time to time, it works, but when it
doesn't, it seems to be related to other user or system definable
dot-files or whatever.
.PP
Changing the value of the
.BR screen_win ,
.BR crt_win ,
or
.B msg_win
variables after the tool is running simply has no effect.
.PP
When using
.B vi
in the tool mode, the window is periodically one or more
lines \*Qshort.\*U
That is, scrolling is off by one line and you have to redraw the
window (using \*Qz.\*U in vi) to get it in sync again.  The problem
is caused by the window having less than 24 lines in the window.
Having the tty subwindow be
.I exactly
24 lines usually eliminates the problem.  This is a bug with SunView
and will not be fixed since Sun no longer supports it.
.PP
When running on full filesystems,
.I Mush
may complain or not even run since it needs temporary space with which
to work.
Instead of finding new filesystems on its own,
.I Mush
leaves this task up to the user.
The workaround is to set the variable
.B tmpdir
in the initialization file to be a writable place in a filesystem that
has enough disk space.
Note: some systems' setcwd() system call writes temporary information in
/tmp and this cannot be overridden.  You may get error messages such as
"file system full" even if your
.B tmpdir
variable is set to a directory in a partition other than that of /tmp.
There is nothing to be concerned about; chance are that you changed
directories and the setcwd() system call can't write to its temp file.
.PP
Repeated sequences of creating and destroying compose frames
uses up file descriptors in Sun OS 3.5, due to a bug where a destroyed
ttysw does not free up its fd's.
.PP
Most of the other known and documented bugs
are in the supplied README files accompanying the source.
The source is also an excellent place to look as many known bugs are
documented in comments.
A good way to track suspicious bugs is to use the
.B debug
command, but note that
this command is very difficult to use in curses mode.
