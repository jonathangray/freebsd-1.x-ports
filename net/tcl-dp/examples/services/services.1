  -- services server and utility scripts
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

The services server solves the following problem: in order for a
client process to connect to a server process, the client process
must first find out the network address and port number of the
server process.  The services server is a dynamic repository of
that information and is intended as an alternative to hardcoding
that information in the client process.
.PP

The services server allows TCP/IP services to advertise a network
address and port number by name, and it allows client processes
to retrieve the network address and port number of any previously
advertised service.  The \fBSun Yellow Pages\fR and the
/etc/services Unix convention are other solutions to the same
problem.
.PP

The services server is implemented using Tcl/Tk (an embeddable
scripting language) with Tcl-DP (Tool Command Language Distributed
Programming).  Clients of the services server must follow Tcl-DP
remote procedure call protocols to communicate with the services
server.
.PP

The services server opens a TCP/IP socket at a well known network
address and port number and waits for clients to connect.
Clients can find this well known network address and port number
encoded in the "/etc/cmcap" file, which should exist on each
machine that runs Berkeley Plateau distributed continuous media
software.  After clients connect to the services server, they can
use remote procedure calls to query and to advertise on the services
server.  (See services(l), Tcl-DP, and /etc/cmcap man pages.)
.SH SERVICES SERVER DAEMON
.PP
.TP 
\fBserviced\fR

The \fBserviced\fR script starts a daemon process that is the
services server.  It must be executed on the machine with the
well known network address described above and should be running
at all times.  
.SH SERVICES SERVER CLIENTS
.PP

The following utility scripts are useful for maintaining and
querying the services server from Unix.
.TP 
\fBlservices\fR

This script lists the names of all services that are currently
advertised with the services server.
.TP
\fBrmservice\fR \fIservice\fR

This script unadvertises an advertised service of the given name,
\fIservice\fR, that is currently advertised in the services server.
.TP
\fBkillservice\fR \fIservice\fR

This script queries the services server for an advertised service
of the given name, \fIservice\fR, becomes a client of that
advertised service, and commands that advertised service (through
Tcl-DP remote procedure call) to exit.  Obviously, the advertised
service must follow Tcl-DP remote procedure call protocols.
