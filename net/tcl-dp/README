This directory contains a freely distributable extension to Tcl/Tk
called Tcl Distributed Programming (Tcl-DP).  Tcl-DP adds TCP and IP
connection management, remote procedure call (RPC), and distributed
object protocols to Tcl/Tk.  A C interface to the RPC primitives is
also provided.  Unlike the "send" command of Tk, Tcl-DP does not
require that Tcl/Tk processes that want to communicate share an X
server because Tcl-DP is built directly upon TCP/IP.

BACKGROUND

Tcl stands for the Tool Command Language, a freely distributable,
embeddable scripting language package.  Tk is an freely distributable X
windows interface toolkit and widget library implemented by a
collection of new commands added to Tcl.  Information about Tcl/Tk is
available by anonymous ftp from sprite.berkeley.edu [128.32.150.27].
Tcl-DP was originally developed for Tcl 6.5 and Tk 3.0.  Tcl-DP Version
3.0 is compatible with Tcl 7.3 and Tk 3.6.

This distribution contains the source code for Tcl-DP, man pages that
describe the commands, and several examples that illustrate how to use
Tcl-DP to build simple distributed applications.  Tcl-DP is available
by anonymous ftp from toe.berkeley.edu [128.32.149.117] in the
/pub/multimedia/Tcp-DP directory.

The Makefile creates a library, libdpnetwork.a, that can be linked with
your application programs.  To use Tcl-DP, you must initialize your Tcl
interpreters with the Tdp_Init C procedure (see dp.h and tkAppInit.c).
After initialization, all distributed programming can be done with Tcl
commands.

In the examples subdirectory, several sample applications are supplied
that use Tcl-DP.  As you can see from the examples, the distributed
programming mechanisms of Tcl-DP are very simple.  A dp_RPC command,
for example, sends a Tcl command to a remote process, which evaluates
the command in the destination Tcl interpreter and returns the result
as the value of the dp_RPC command.

The services subdirectory contains an extended example of Tcl-DP.  It
contains Tcl-DP scripts to implement a name server, a daemon to which
server applications can advertise their location, and from which client
applications can locate the servers.  See services/README.

COMPILING/USING TCL-DP

To compile the dpwish program:

+) If you do not already have Tcl 7.3 and Tk 3.6, get a copy and follow
the instructions to build the system.  Tcl-DP 3.0 may not work with
earlier versions of Tcl/Tk.  Although not required, we recommend that
you place tcl-dp3.0 in a sibling directory to tcl7.3 and tk3.6, and
then make a symlink from tcl-dp3.0 to tcl-dp.

+) In the tcl-dp directory (i.e., where this README resides), type
"./configure".  This runs a configuration script created by GNU
autoconf, which configures Tcl for your system and creates a Makefile.
The configure script allows you to customize the Tk configuration for
your site; for details on how you can do this, see the file
"configure.info".

+) Type "make".  This will create a library archive called
"libdpnetwork.a" and a Tcl-DP extended wish called "dpwish."

+) Type "make install" to install Tcl-DP's binaries, library files,
and manual pages in standard places.  In the default configuration
information will be installed in /usr/local so you'll need write
permission on this directory.

To learn how to use Tcl-DP:

+) Read the README file in the examples subdirectory and play with
the example applications.

+) Read the Tcl-DP man page (Tcl-DP.l), and the other man pages 
in the doc subdirectory.

To report bugs, bug fixes, descriptions of interesting Tcl-DP 
applications, and suggested improvements:

+) Send email to tcl-dp@roger-rabbit.CS.Berkeley.EDU or
tcl-dp-bugs@roger-rabbit.CS.Berkeley.EDU

or

+) Post an article in the comp.lang.tcl newsgroup.

We extend our thanks to everyone who helped to create, debug, and
distribute this software.  Although there are too many people to mention
at this point, the following people deserve special attention:

  John Ousterhout, creator of Tcl/Tk; 
  Pekka Nikander, creator of tcpConnect;
  Tim MacKenzie, creator of tclRawTCP;
  Lou Salkind, ported Tcl-DP to Tcl 7.0/Tk 3.3
  R Lindsay Todd, developed security mechanism
  Craig Federighi, developed extended name server code
